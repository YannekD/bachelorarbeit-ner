PAMPHLET 7
[Daniel Dulany], Considerations on the Propriety of Imposing
Taxes in the British Colonies, for the Purpose of Raising a
Revenue, by Act of Parliament. [Annapolis], 1765.
Whately’s Regulations Lately Made was soon joined by other defenses of the Stamp Act, including
The Objections to the Taxation of Our American Colonies . . . Considered by Soame Jenyns, a poet
and former member of the Board of Trade, and The Claim of the Colonies to an Exemption from
Internal Taxes Imposed by Authority of Parliament, Examined by William Knox, a former colonial
official. Americans read these pamphlets with great interest and alarm, knowing that these assertions
of parliamentary power had to be answered.
The most formidable among the rejoinders was the following anonymous pamphlet. Its author was
Daniel Dulany, son of a prominent and wealthy Maryland family, who had been educated at
Cambridge and studied law at Middle Temple in London before returning home to be admitted to the
Maryland bar in 1747. Over the next two decades he enjoyed a number of elective and appointive
positions in the colony, and in 1765 he was its secretary, commissary general, and a member of the
governor’s council. In his pamphlet Dulany did not actually repudiate the theory of virtual
representation and its claim that certain people from society, if their interests were identical with the
rest, could justly speak for the whole. For Dulany, the fallacy in Whately’s contention lay not in the
inability of the colonists to vote for members of Parliament but rather in the fact that the interests of
the English—electors, nonelectors, and representatives alike—were in no way identical with those of
the colonists. In other words, he implied that Britons and Americans were not really one people after
all.
This pamphlet was quickly reprinted throughout the colonies, and a London edition appeared the
following year. Although he later became a Loyalist, in 1765 Daniel Dulany’s was one of the most
important voices in support of the patriot cause.

would, now, be an unfashionable Doctrine, whatever the ancient

Opinion might be, to affirm that the Constituent can bind his

Representative by Instructions; but tho’ the obligatory Force of these
Instructions is not insisted upon, yet their persuasive Influence, in most
Cases, may be; for a Representative, who should act against the explicit
Recommendation of his Constituents, would most deservedly forfeit their
Regard and all Pretension to their future Confidence.
When it is under Deliberation, whether a new Law shall be Enacted, in
which the Electors of England are interested, THEY have Notice of it, and an
Opportunity of declaring their Sense—THEY may point out every dangerous
Tendency, and are not restrained in their Representations, from shewing in
the plainest Language, the Injustice or Oppression of it.
When a Law in it’s Execution is found to be repugnant to the Genius
of Liberty, or productive of Hardships or Inconvenience, THEY may also
instruct their Deputies to exert Themselves in procuring a Repeal of it, and
in the Exercise of this Right are not constrained to whine in the Style of
humble Petitioners.—THEY are exposed to no Danger in explaining their
Reasons—THEIR Situation does not become so delicate as to make it
prudent, to weaken, by not urging them, with their full Force, and to their
utmost Extent. But who are the Representatives of the Colonies? To whom
shall THEY send their Instructions, when desirous to obtain the Repeal of a
Law striking at the Root and Foundation of every Civil Right, should such
an one take Place? Instructions to all the Members who compose the House
of Commons would not be proper. To them the Application must be by
Petition, in which an unreserved Style would, probably, be deemed

Indecency, and strong Expressions Insolence, in which a Claim of Rights
may not, perhaps, be explained, or even insinuated, if to impugn, or glance
at their Authority whose Relief is supplicated. To soften and deprecate must
be the Hope and Endeavour, tho’ a guiltless Freeman would, probably, be
aukward in ringing all the Changes of Parce, Precor.
Under these Circumstances, the Liberty of the Press is of the most
momentous Consequence, for if Truth is not allowed to speak thence in it’s
genuine Language of Plainness and Simplicity, nor Freedom to vindicate
it’s Privileges with decent Firmness, we shall have too much Reason to
acknowledge his Foresight who predicted, that, “the Constitution of the
British Government was too excellent to be permament.” The Train for the
Accomplishment of that Prophecy hath not yet catched in America, nor, I
trust, been laid.
That there have been Laws extremely unjust and oppressive, the
Declarations of subsequent Parliaments, fixing this Stigma upon them,
evince; but whilst the Power which introduced them prevailed, it was not
prudent to give them their deserved Characters. The Parliament of Henry
III, or that of Henry VI, need not be cited; there are many other Instances,
tho’ not branded with Epithets so remarkably opprobrious.
In the Opinion of a great Lawyer, an Act of Parliament may be void,
and of a great Divine, “all Men have natural, and Freemen legal Rights,
which they may justly maintain, and no legislative Authority can deprive
them of.”
Cases may be imagined in which the Truth of these Positions might, in
Theory, be admitted; but in Practice, unless there should be very peculiar
Circumstances, such as can’t be supposed to exist during the Prevalence of
the Power that introduced it, who would rely upon the Authority of

Opinions, or the Principles of them, for his Protection against the Penalties
of any positive Law?
When the Judges were ask’d by Henry VIII, Whether a Man might be
attainted of High Treason by Parliament, tho’ not called to answer, they
declared that it was a dangerous Question, and gave the evasive Answer
that, “the High Court of Parliament ought to give Examples of Justice to the
inferior Courts, none of which could do the like.” But tho’ it might be
dangerous to declare against the Authority of Parliament, we are not bound
to acknowledge it’s Inerrability, nor precluded from examining the
Principles and Consequences of Laws, or from pointing out their
Improprieties, and Defects. Upon this Ground I have proceeded in the
following Considerations, and shall not be disappointed if they should
appear to be too free, or too reserved, to Readers of different Complexions.
VIRGINIA, AUGUST 12, 1765.

Considerations, &c.

I

N

the Constitution of England, the Three principal Forms of

Government, Monarchy, Aristocracy and Democracy, are blended
together in certain Proportions; but each of these Orders, in the Exercise of
the legislative Authority, hath its peculiar Department, from which the other
are excluded. In this Division, the Granting of Supplies, or Laying Taxes, is
deemed to be the Province of the House of Commons, as the Representative
of the People.—All Supplies are supposed to flow from their Gift; and the
other Orders are permitted only to assent, or reject generally, not to propose
any Modification, Amendment, or partial Alteration of it.
This Observation being considered, it will undeniably appear, that, in
framing the late Stamp Act, the Commons acted in the Character of
Representative of the Colonies. They assumed it as the Principle of that
Measure, and the Propriety of it must therefore stand, or fall, as the
Principle is true, or false: For the Preamble sets forth, That the Commons of
Great Britain had resolved to Give and Grant the several Rates and Duties
imposed by the Act; but what Right had the Commons of Great Britain to
be thus munificent at the Expence of the Commons of America?—To give
Property, not belonging to the Giver, and without the Consent of the Owner,
is such evident and flagrant Injustice, in ordinary Cases, that few are hardy
enough to avow it; and therefore, when it really happens, the Fact is
disguised and varnished over by the most plausible Pretences the Ingenuity
of the Giver can suggest.—But it is alledged that there is a Virtual, or
implied Representation of the Colonies springing out of the Constitution of
the British Government: And it must be confessed on all Hands, that, as the

Representation is not actual, it is virtual, or it doth not exist at all; for no
third Kind of Representation can be imagined. The Colonies claim the
Privilege, which is common to all British Subjects, of being taxed only with
their own Consent given by their Representatives, and all the Advocates for
the Stamp Act admit this Claim. Whether, therefore, upon the whole Matter,
the Imposition of the Stamp Duties is a proper Exercise of Constitutional
Authority, or not, depends upon the single Question, Whether the Commons
of Great Britain are virtually the Representatives of the Commons of
America, or not.
The Advocates for the Stamp Act admit, in express Terms, that “the
Colonies do not chuse Members of Parliament,” but They assert that “the
Colonies are virtually represented in the same Manner with the NonElectors resident in Great Britain.”
How have They proved this Position? Where have They defined, or
precisely explained what They mean by the Expression, Virtual
Representation? As it is the very Hinge upon which the Rectitude of the
Taxation turns, something more satisfactory than mere Assertion, more
solid than a Form of Expression, is necessary; for, how can it be seriously
expected, that Men, who think Themselves injuriously affected in their
Properties and Privileges, will be convinced and reconciled by a fanciful
Phrase, the Meaning of which can’t be precisely ascertained by those who
use it, or properly applied to the Purpose for which it hath been advanced.
They argue, that “the Right of Election being annexed to certain
Species of Property, to Franchises, and Inhabitancy in some particular
Places, a very small Part of the Land, the Property, and the People of
England is comprehended in those Descriptions. All Landed Property, not
Freehold, and all Monied Property, are excluded. The Merchants of London,
the Proprietors of the Public Funds, the Inhabitants of Leeds, Halifax,

Birmingham, and Manchester, and that great Corporation of the East-India
Company, None of Them chuse their Representatives, and yet are They all
represented in Parliament, and the Colonies being exactly in their Situation,
are represented in the same Manner.”
Now, this Argument, which is all that their Invention hath been able to
supply, is totally defective; for, it consists of Facts not true, and of
Conclusions inadmissible.
It is so far from being true, that all the Persons enumerated under the
Character of Non-Electors, are in that Predicament, that it is indubitably
certain there is no Species of Property, landed, or monied, which is not
possessed by very many of the British Electors.
I shall undertake to disprove the supposed Similarity of Situation,
whence the same Kind of Representation is deduced of the Inhabitants of
the Colonies, and of the British Non-Electors; and, if I succeed, the Notion
of a virtual Representation of the Colonies must fail, which, in Truth, is a
mere Cob-web, spread to catch the unwary, and intangle the weak. I would
be understood. I am upon a Question of Propriety, not of Power; and,
though some may be inclined to think it is to little Purpose to discuss the
one, when the other is irresistible, yet are They different Considerations;
and, at the same Time that I invalidate the Claim upon which it is founded, I
may very consistently recommend a Submission to the Law, whilst it
endures. I shall say Nothing of the Use I intend by the Discussion; for, if it
should not be perceived by the Sequel, there is no Use in it, and, if it should
appear then, it need not be premised.
Lessees for Years, Copyholders, Proprietors of the Public Funds,
Inhabitants of Birmingham, Leeds, Halifax, and Manchester, Merchants of
the City of London, or Members of the Corporation of the East-India
Company, are, as such, under no personal Incapacity to be Electors; for they

may acquire the Right of Election, and there are actually not only a
considerable Number of Electors in each of the Classes of Lessees for
Years, &c. but in many of them, if not all, even Members of Parliament.
The Interests therefore of the Non-Electors, the Electors, and the
Representatives, are individually the same; to say nothing of the Connection
among Neighbours, Friends, and Relations. The Security of the NonElectors against Oppression, is, that their Oppression will fall also upon the
Electors and the Representatives. The one can’t be injured, and the other
indemnified.
Further, if the Non-Electors should not be taxed by the British
Parliament, They would not be taxed at all; and it would be iniquitous, as
well as a Solecism, in the political System, that They should partake of all
the Benefits resulting from the Imposition, and Application of Taxes, and
derive an Immunity from the Circumstance of not being qualified to vote.
Under this Constitution then, a double or virtual Representation may be
reasonably supposed.—The Electors, who are inseparably connected in
their Interests with the Non-Electors, may be justly deemed to be the
Representatives of the Non-Electors, at the same Time They exercise their
personal Privilege in their Right of Election, and the Members chosen,
therefore, the Representatives of both. This is the only rational Explanation
of the Expression, virtual Representation. None has been advanced by the
Assertors of it, and their Meaning can only be inferred from the Instances,
by which They endeavour to elucidate it, and no other Meaning can be
stated, to which the Instances apply.
It is an essential Principle of the English Constitution, that the Subject
shall not be taxed without his Consent, which hath not been introduced by
any particular Law, but necessarily results from the Nature of that mixed
Government; for, without it, the Order of Democracy could not exist.

Parliaments were not formerly so regular in Point of Form as they now
are.1 Even the Number of Knights for each Shire were not ascertained. The
first Writs now extant for their Choice, are 22d Edward I, by which, Two, as
at this Day, were directed to be chosen for each County; but the King not
being satisfied with that Number, other Writs were issued for chusing Two
more. This discretionary Power being thought inconvenient, was afterwards
restrained by the Statutes of Richard II, Henry IV, and subsequent Acts.
In earlier Times there was more Simplicity in the Rules of
Government, and Men were more solicitous about the Essentials, than the
Forms of it. When the Consent of those who were to perform, or pay any
Thing extra-feudal, was fairly applied for and obtained, the Manner was
little regarded; but, as the People had reason to be jealous of Designs to
impose Contributions upon Them without their Consent, it was thought
expedient to have Formalities regulated, and fixed, to prevent this Injury to
their Rights, not to destroy a Principle, without which, They could not be
said to have any Rights at all.
Before the Introduction of those Formalities, which were framed with
a View to restrain the Excursions of Power, and to secure the Privileges of
the Subject, as the Mode of Proceeding was more simple, so perhaps this
Foundation of Consent was more visible than it is at present, wherefore it
may be of Use to adduce some Instances, which directly point out this
necessary and essential Principle of British Liberty.
The Lords and Commons have separately given Aids and Subsidies to
the Crown. In 13th Edward III, the Lords granted the Tenth of all the Corn,
&c. growing upon their Demesnes, the Commons then granting Nothing,
nor concerning Themselves with what the Lords thought fit to grant out of
their own Estates.—At other Times, the Knights of Shires, separating from
the rest of the Commons, and joining with the Lords, have granted a

Subsidy, and the Representatives of Cities and Boroughs have likewise
granted Subsidies to the Crown separately, as appears by a Writ in 24th
Edward I, which runs in these Words: Rex, &c.—Cum Comites, Barones,
Milites Nobis, &c. fecerunt undecimam de omnibus Bonis suis mobilibus, et
Cives et Burgenses, &c. septimam de omnibus Bonis suis mobilibus, &c.
nobis curialiter concesserint, &c.—When an Affair happened, which
affected only some Individuals, and called for an Aid to the Crown, it was
common for those Individuals alone to be summoned; to which Purpose
several Writs arc extant. In 35th Edward III, there is a Writ (which Dugdale
has printed in his Collection of Writs of Summons to Parliament) directed
to the Earl of Northampton, which, after reciting the Confusion the Affairs
of Ireland were in, and that he, and some other English Lords had
Possessions in that Kingdom, and were therefore more particularly obliged
to the Defence of it, follows in these Words: Volumus Vobiscum, et cum aliis
de eodem Regno (Angliæ scilicet) Terras in dictâ Terrâ habentibus
Colloquium habere, &c.
But, that the Reader may perceive how strictly the Principle of no
Persons being Taxed without their Consent, hath been regarded, it is proper
to take Notice, that, upon the same Occasion, Writs were likewise directed
even to Women, who were Proprietors of Land in Ireland, to send their
Deputies to consult, and consent to what should be judged necessary to be
done on the Occasion; e. g. Rex, &c.—Mariæ, &c. Salutem, &c. Vobis, &c.
Mandamus quod aliquem, vel aliquos de quibus confidatis apud Westmon.
mittatis ad loquendum nobiscum super dictis Negotiis, et ad faciendum et
consentiendum Nomine vestro, super hoc quod ibidem ordinari contigerit.
A Reflection naturally arises from the Instances cited—When, on a
particular Occasion, some Individuals only were to be taxed, and not the
whole Community, their Consent only was called for, and in the last

Instance it appears, that they, who upon an Occasion of a general Tax,
would have been bound by the Consent of their virtual Representatives (for
in that Case they would have had no actual Representatives) were in an
Affair calling for a particular Aid from them, separate from the rest of the
Community, required to send their particular Deputies. But how different
would be the Principle of a Statute, imposing Duties without their Consent
who are to pay them, upon the Authority of their Gift, who should
undertake to give, what doth not belong to them.
That great King, Edward I, inserted in his Writs of Summons, as a first
Principle of Law, that quod omnes tangat ab omnibus approbetur, which by
no Torture can be made to signify that their Approbation or Consent only is
to be required in the Imposition of a Tax, who are to pay no Part of it.
The Situation of the Non-Electors in England—their Capacity to
become Electors—their inseparable Connection with those who are
Electors, and their Representatives—their Security against Oppression
resulting from this Connection, and the Necessity of imagining a double or
virtual Representation, to avoid Iniquity and Absurdity, have been
explained—The Inhabitants of the Colonies are, as such, incapable of being
Electors, the Privilege of Election being exerciseable only in Person, and
therefore if every Inhabitant of America had the requisite Freehold, not one
could vote, but upon the Supposition of his ceasing to be an Inhabitant of
America, and becoming a Resident in Great-Britain, a Supposition which
would be impertinent, because it shifts the Question—Should the Colonies
not be taxed by Parliamentary Impositions, their respective Legislatures
have a regular, adequate, and constitutional Authority to Tax them, and
therefore there would not necessarily be an iniquitous and absurd
Exemption, from their not being represented by the House of Commons.

There is not that intimate and inseparable Relation between the
Electors of Great-Britain and the Inhabitants of the Colonies, which must
inevitably involve both in the same Taxation; on the contrary, not a single
actual Elector in England, might be immediately affected by a Taxation in
America, imposed by a Statute which would have a general Operation and
Effect, upon the Properties of the Inhabitants of the Colonies. The latter
might be oppressed in a Thousand Shapes, without any Sympathy, or
exciting any Alarm in the former. Moreover, even Acts, oppressive and
injurious to the Colonies in an extreme Degree, might become popular in
England, from the Promise or Expectation, that the very Measures which
depressed the Colonies, would give Ease to the Inhabitants of GreatBritain. It is indeed true, that the Interests of England and the Colonies are
allied, and an Injury to the Colonies produced into all it’s Consequences,
will eventually affect the Mother Country, yet these Consequences being
generally remote, are not at once foreseen; they do not immediately alarm
the Fears, and engage the Passions of the English Electors, the Connection
between a Freeholder of Great Britain, and a British American being
deducible only through a Train of Reasoning, which few will take the
Trouble, or can have an Opportunity, if they have Capacity, to investigate;
wherefore the Relation between the British-Americans, and the English
Electors, is a Knot too infirm to be relied on as a competent Security,
especially against the Force of a present, counteracting Expectation of
Relief.
If it would have been a just Conclusion, that the Colonies being
exactly in the same Situation with the Non-Electors of England, are
therefore represented in the same Manner, it ought to be allowed, that the
Reasoning is solid, which, after having evinced a total Dissimilarity of
Situation, infers that their Representation is different.

If the Commons of Great-Britain have no Right by the Constitution, to
GIVE AND GRANT Property not belonging to themselves or others,
without their Consent actually or virtually given—If the Claim of the
Colonies not to be taxed without their Consent, signified by their
Representatives, is well founded, if it appears that the Colonies are not
actually represented by the Commons of Great-Britain, and that the Notion
of a double or virtual Representation, doth not with any Propriety apply to
the People of America; then the Principle of the Stamp Act, must be given
up as indefensible on the Point of Representation, and the Validity of it
rested upon the Power which they who framed it, have to carry it into
Execution.
“Should the Parliament devise a Tax, to be paid only by those of the
People in Great-Britain, who are neither Members of either House of
Parliament, nor their Electors, such an Act would be unjust and partial,”
saith the Author of the Claim of the Colonies, &c. who yet allows that the
“Non-Electors would have a Security against the Weight of such a Tax,
should it be imposed, which the Colonies have not, Viz. That the Members
of Parliament and their Electors, must be relatively affected by it; but the
industrious North-American, and the opulent West-Indian may have their
Properties taxed, and no Individual in Great-Britain participate with them
in the Burden: On the contrary, the Members of Parliament would make
their Court to their Constituents most effectually, by multiplying Taxes
upon the Subjects of the Colonies.”
Is it not amazing that the above Author, with these Sentiments, should
undertake the Defence of the Stamp Duties, which, by his own Concession,
appear to be more unjust, and more partial than the Tax he supposes, and
upon which he bestows, very properly, the Epithets of unjust and partial?
——Diluit Helleborum, certô compescere Punctô

Nescius Examen.
But it has been objected, that if the Inhabitants of America, because
represented in their respective Assemblies, are therefore exempted from a
Parliamentary Tax, then the Citizens of London, who are represented in
their Common Council, may plead the same Immunity. If it were not for the
Authority upon which this Objection is urged it might be safely passed over
without a particular Answer; but since it hath been introduced with an
Appearance of Reliance, and the Opinion which it retails, is said to have
been delivered with great Gravity, and pronounced with decisive
Confidence, I would not be so wanting in Respect to an eminent Character,
as to neglect the Ceremony of a direct Refutation.
But I must observe that, when the Opinion of a Lawyer is taken in a
Matter of private Concern, in which he is under no Bias to deceive, a
concise Declaration of it may generally suffice; he who applies for it being
generally obliged to depend upon his Council’s Character of Integrity and
Knowledge, not only because the Expence of a methodical and minute
Discussion would be too Burthensome, but because the Force of legal
Reasoning is not generally understood. But in a Question of Public
Concernment, the Opinion of no Court Lawyer, however respectable for his
Candour and Abilities, ought to weigh more than the Reasons adduced in
Support of it. They ought to be explained, they may be examined.
Considering his Temptations, Credit ought to be cautiously and diffidently
given, to his Assertion of what is his Opinion.—Considering the
Consequence of a Decision, not to one Man only, but to Millions that exist
and Myriads that may exist, and the exceeding Fallibility of legal
Knowledge, nothing short of clear Conviction, after the fullest Explication
of the Reasons of the Opinion, and the most accurate and intense
Consideration of their Validity, can justify an Acquiescence under it.

On the present Occasion, so immensely important, Nullius addictus
jurare in Verba Magistri, I shall pin my Faith upon the Dictum of no
Lawyer in the Universe, and when his ipse dixit is authoritatively urged, I
shall be at no Pains to repress my Suspicions that his Reasons are
concealed, because, if fairly produced and held up to the Light, many Flaws
in them would be discovered by a careful Examiner. I have lived long
enough to remember many Opinions of Court Lawyers upon American
Affairs; they have been all strongly marked with the same Character; they
have been generally very sententious, and the same Observation may be
applied to them all—They have all declared that to be legal, which the
Minister for the Time being has deemed to be expedient. The Opinion given
by a General of the Law in the late War on the Question, Whether Soldiers
might be Quartered on Private Houses in America, must be pretty generally
remembered.
The very learned Gentlemen has, it seems, declared that, “upon mature
Deliberation, he has formed his Opinion, that the Colonies are in their
Nature, no more than common Corporations, and that the Inhabitants of a
Colony are no more entitled to an Exemption from Parliamentary Taxations,
because represented in an American Assembly, than the Citizens of
London.”
This Opinion may be incontestably just in the Judgment of that
accomplished Politician, and elegant Writer, who chuses to distinguish
himself by the Titles of late G—rn—r of the J—rs—ys, of the M—ss—ch—s
—ts B—, and of S—th C—r—l—a, and who does not chuse to be
distinguish’d by the Title of late Mâitre d’Hotel of the late Sir D—v—s O—
b—e, or that exactly fitting, and characteristical Appellation conferred on
him, by an incensed Culprit in an American Court of Star-Chamber, an
Appellation rather adapted to signify those Powers, which are useful in

Intrigue, and that lead to Promotion, than expressive of Respect and
Dignity2; but having considered the Subject in the best Manner my very
slender and limited Capacity will allow, neither doth the Opinion of the one,
nor the Approbation of it by the other, influence my Judgment.
Let a great Man declare a Similitude, and he will soon find a Polonius
to acknowledge, that, “Yonder Cloud is, by the Mass, like a Camel
indeed”—or, “black like an Ouzle,”—or, “very like a Whale.”
The Objection having been Stated, the Answer is obvious and clear.
The Colonies have a compleat and adequate Legislative Authority, and
are not only represented in their Assemblies, but in no other Manner. The
Power of making Bye-Laws vested in the common Council is inadequate
and incompleat, being bounded by a few particular Subjects; and the
Common Council are actually represented too, by having a Choice of
Members to serve in Parliament. How then can the Reason of the
Exemption from internal Parliamentary Taxations, claimed by the Colonies,
apply to the Citizens of London?
The Power described in the Provincial Charters is to make Laws, and
in the Exercise of that Power, the Colonies are bounded by no other
Limitations than what result from their Subordination to, and Dependance
upon Great-Britain. The Term Bye-Laws is as novel, and improper, when
applied to the Assemblies, as the Expression Acts of Assembly would be, if
applied to the Parliament of Great-Britain, and it is as absurd and
insensible, to call a Colony a common Corporation, because not an
independant Kingdom, and the Powers of each to make Laws and Bye
Laws, are limited, tho’ not comparable in their Extent, and the Variety of
their Objects, as it would be to call Lake Erie, a Duck-puddle, because not
the Atlantic Ocean.

Should the Analogy between the Colonies and Corporations be even
admitted for a Moment, in order to see what would be the Consequence of
the Postulatum, it would only amount to this, The Colonies are vested with
as compleat Authority to all Intents and Purposes to Tax themselves, as any
English Corporation is to make a Bye-Law, in any imaginable Instance for
any local Purpose whatever, and the Parliament doth not make Laws for
Corporations upon Subjects, in every Respect proper for Bye-Laws.
But I don’t rest the Matter upon this, or any other Circumstance,
however considerable, to prove the Impropriety of a Taxation by the British
Parliament. I rely upon the Fact, that not one Inhabitant in any Colony is, or
can be actually or virtually represented by the British House of Commons,
and therefore, that the Stamp Duties are severely imposed.
But it has been alledged, that if the Right to Give and Grant the
Property of the Colonies by an internal Taxation is denied to the House of
Commons, the Subordination or Dependance of the Colonies, and the
Superintendence of the British Parliament can’t be consistently establish’d
—That any supposed Line of Distinction between the Two Cases, is but “a
whimsical Imagination, a chimerical Speculation against Fact and
Experience.”—Now, under Favour, I conceive there is more Confidence,
than Solidity in this Assertion, and it may be satisfactorily and easily
proved, that the Subordination and Dependance of the Colonies may be
preserved, and the supreme Authority of the Mother-Country be firmly
supported, and yet the Principle of Representation, and the Right of the
British House of Commons flowing from it, to Give and Grant the Property
of the Commons of America, be denied.
The Colonies are dependant upon Great Britain, and the supreme
Authority vested in the King, Lords, and Commons, may justly be exercised
to secure, or preserve their Dependance, whenever necessary for that

Purpose. This Authority results from, and is implied in the Idea of the
Relation subsisting between England and her Colonies; for, considering the
Nature of human Affections, the Inferior is not to be trusted with providing
Regulations to prevent his Rising to an Equality with his Superior. But,
though the Right of the Superior to use the proper Means for preserving the
Subordination of his Inferior is admitted, yet it does not necessarily follow,
that he has a Right to seize the Property of his Inferior when he pleases, or
to command him in every Thing, since, in the Degrees of it, there may very
well exist a Dependance and Inferiority, without absolute Vassalage and
Slavery. In what the Superior may rightfully controul, or compel, and in
what the Inferior ought to be at Liberty to act without Controul or
Compulsion, depends upon the Nature of the Dependance, and the Degree
of the Subordination; and, these being ascertained, the Measure of
Obedience, and Submission, and the Extent of the Authority and
Superintendence will be settled. When Powers, compatible with the
Relation between the Superior and Inferior, have, by express Compact, been
granted to, and accepted by the latter, and have been, after that Compact,
repeatedly recognized by the former—When They may be exercised
effectually upon every Occasion without any Injury to that Relation, the
Authority of the Superior can’t properly interpose; for, by the Powers
vested in the Inferior, is the Superior limited.
By their Constitutions of Government, the Colonies are impowered to
impose internal Taxes. This Power is compatible with their Dependance,
and hath been expressly recognized by British Ministers and the British
Parliament, upon many Occasions; and it may be exercised effectually
without striking at, or impeaching, in any Respect, the Superintendence of
the British Parliament. May not then the Line be distinctly and justly drawn
between such Acts as are necessary, or proper, for preserving or securing

the Dependance of the Colonies, and such as are not necessary or proper for
that very important Purpose?
When the Powers were conferred upon the Colonies, They were
conferred too as Privileges and Immunities, and accepted as such; or, to
speak more properly, the Privileges belonging necessarily to Them as
British Subjects, were solemnly declared and confirmed by their Charters,
and They who settled in America under the Encouragement and Faith of
these Charters, understood, not only that They might, but that it was their
Right to exercise those Powers without Controul, or Prevention. In some of
the Charters the Distinction is expressed, and the strongest Declarations
made, and the most solemn Assurances given that the Settlers should not
have their Property taxed without their own Consent by their
Representatives, though their legislative Authority is limited at the same
Time, by the Subordination implied in their Relation, and They are
therefore restrained from making Acts of Assembly repugnant to the Laws
of England, and, had the Distinction not been expressed, the Powers given
would have implied it, for, if the Parliament may in any Case interpose,
when the Authority of the Colonies is adequate to the Occasion, and not
limited by their Subordination to the Mother-Country, it may in every Case,
which would make another Appellation more proper to describe their
Condition, than the Name by which their Inhabitants have been usually
called, and have Gloried in.
Because the Parliament may, when the Relation between Great-Britain
and her Colonies calls for an Exertion of her Superintendance, bind the
Colonies by Statute, therefore a Parliamentary Interposition in every other
Instance, is justifiable, is an Inference that may be denied.
On some Emergencies, the King, by the Constitution, hath an absolute
Power to provide for the Safety of the State, to take Care, like a Roman

Dictator, ne quid Detrimenti capiat Respublica, and this Power is not
specifically annexed to the Monarchy by any express Law; it necessarily
results from the End and Nature of Government, but who would infer from
this, that the King, in every Instance, or upon every Occasion, can, upon the
Principles of the Constitution, exercise this supreme Power?
The British Ministers have, in the most effectual Terms, at different
Periods, from the Reign of Charles II, to that of the present King,
recognized this Distinction in their Requisitions, transmitted to the Colonies
to raise and levy Men and Money, by Acts of Assembly; and recently, in the
Course of the last War, they were so far from thinking that it was proper for
the British House of Commons to Give and Grant the Property of the
Colonies to support the military Operations in America, upon which not
only the immediate Protection of that Part of the British Dominions, but the
most important Interests, perhaps the ultimate Preservation of Great Britain
from Destruction, essentially depended; I say, on this great Occasion of the
most important, and national Concernment, the British Ministers were so
far from calling upon the House of Commons, in their peculiar Department,
to Give and Grant Property, belonging neither to Themselves, nor their
Constituents, that They directly applied to the Colonies to tax Themselves,
in Virtue of the Authority and Privilege conferred by their Charters, and
promised to recommend it to the British Parliament to reimburse the
Expence They should incur in providing for the general Service.—They
made good their Promise; and, if all the Money raised in the Colonies, by
Acts of Assembly, in pursuance of the Requisitions of the British Ministers,
hath not been repaid by Parliament, a very considerable Part of it hath.
Could They, who made the Requisitions I have mentioned, or the
Assemblies that complied with them, intend, or imagine the Faith of the
English Government was to be preserved by a Retribution, at one Time, of

the Money disbursed at the Instance, and upon the Credit of the British
Ministry, enforced and supported by Royal Assurances, and by taking it
back again at another Time? Is this Method of keeping the Faith of
Government to be ranked among the “Improvements which have been made
beyond the Idea of former Administrations, concluded by Ministers
ignorant of the Importance of the Colonies, or who impotently neglected
their Concerns, or were diverted by mean Pursuits, from attending to
Them?” Is it absolutely certain, that there never can, at any future Period,
arise a Crisis, in which the Exertion of the Colonies may be necessary, or, if
there should, that it will bring with it an Oblivion of all former Indirection?
—But this is a Subject fitter for silent Meditation, than public Discussion.
There was a Time when Measures of Prevention might have been
taken by the Colonies.—There may be a Time when Redress may be
obtained—Till then, Prudence, as well as Duty, requires Submission.
It is presumed that it was a notable Service done by New-England,
when the Militia of that Colony reduced Cape-Breton, since it enabled the
British Ministers to make a Peace less disadvantageous and inglorious than
They otherwise must have been constrained to submit to, in the humble
State to which they were then reduc’d.—That the general Exertion of the
Colonies in North-America, during the last War, not only facilitated, but
was indispensably requisite to the Success of those Operations by which so
many glorious Conquests were atchieved, and that those Conquests have
put it in the Power of the present illustrious Ministers to make a Peace upon
Terms of so much Glory and Advantage, as to afford an inexhaustible
Subject during their Administration, and the Triumph of Toryism, at least,
for their ingenious Panegyrists to celebrate.
An American, without justly incurring the Imputation of Ingratitude,
may doubt, whether some other Motive, besides pure Generosity, did not

prompt the British Nation to engage in the Defence of the Colonies.—He
may be induced to think that the Measures taken for the Protection of the
Plantations, were not only connected with the Interests, but even necessary
to the Defence of Great-Britain herself, because he may have Reason to
imagine that Great-Britain could not long subsist as an independent
Kingdom after the Loss of her Colonies.—He may, without Arrogance, be
inclined to claim some Merit from the Exertion of the Colonies, since it
enabled Great-Britain ultimately to defend herself; I mean that Kind of
Merit which arises from Benefits done to others, by the Operation of
Measures taken for our own Sakes—a Merit most illustriously display’d in
the Generosity of Great-Britain, when, with their Co-operation, she
protected the Colonies to preserve herself.
When an House is in Flames, and the next Neighbour is extremely
active, and exerts his Endeavours to extinguish the Fire, which, if not
conquered, would catch, and consume his own Dwelling, I don’t say, that if
the Owner of the House which had been in Flames, should, after the Fire
subdued, complaisantly thank his Neighbour generally for his Services, he
would be absurdly ceremonious; but, if the Assistant should afterwards
boast of his great Generosity, and claim a Right to the Furniture of the
House which he had assisted in Saving, upon the Merit of his Zeal and
Activity, he would deserve to be put in Mind of the Motive of his Service.
If the Advantages gained by the late most glorious and succesful War
have been secured by an adequate Peace—If the Successes that attended the
military Operations of the British Arms, were the Effect of the conjunct
Efforts of the British Nation and her Colonies, roused by the Spirit, excited
by the Virtue, animated by the Vigour, and conducted by the Wisdom of the
ablest Minister that ever served his Country, has there been no

Compensation received for the Charges of the War? Are the Colonies
entitled to no Credit for it?
When the Design is to oppress the Colonies with Taxes, or calumniate
the late patriotic Minister, the Expences of the War, and the Enormity of the
national Debt are proclaimed: When the present all-accomplish’d
Administration is to be celebrated, then is the immense Value of the new
Acquisitions display’d in the brightest Colours, “Acquisitions vast in
Extent, richly productive of the valuable Commodities belonging to their
several Climates. The Possession of those in North-America, ensures the
Safety of the other Colonies there, insomuch that our only dangerous
Neighbours, the French, do not think the Pittance left worth retaining,
having, by the Cession of Louisiana to the Spaniards, avowedly given up
for ever those great Objects, for which alone They began the War.—The
ceded Islands are almost of equal Advantage, for protecting our own, and
annoying the Settlements of the French and Spaniards, if They should be
again our Enemies.—Part of Nova Scotia, since the Removal of the neutral
French, hath been already settled by 10,000 Inhabitants, within the
Compass of Six or Seven Years, a Province lately considered as no more
than a proper Situation for a Fortress, whose Garrison it could not subsist:
Even Cape-Breton, that barren Appendage to the Province of Nova Scotia,
is known now to contain Treasures so worthy of Attention, as to be reserved
to the Crown. The Mines there are not Veins; they are Mountains of Coal;
vast Clifts of nothing else, stand open, and accessible; no Boring necessary
to find it; no Pit necessary to come at it; no Fire-Engines requisite for
carrying on the Works. This Island, and all the neighbouring Shores in the
Gulph of St. Laurence, have another Fund of Wealth in their Fisheries.
Canada is already a very flourishing Colony, inhabited by 90,000 People,
and their Demand on Great-Britain for a Supply of Manufactures, must be

immediately considerable. The Peltry will be another great Branch of
Commerce. West-Florida is surprizingly fertile, and luxuriantly productive
in its natural State, of every Thing, and not only promising, but actually
producing Wines and Silk, and Indigo, &c. &c.”
Is no Part of this Description the Ebullition of an exuberant Fancy, and
shall we not cast one Glance of Retrospection towards the Man, who, when
his Country was despised, and insulted, and sunk into the most abject
Condition of Despondence, by inspiring her Sons with that invincible
Vigour of Patriotism, with which himself was animated, not only dispelled
her Fears, secured her Safety, and retrieved her Honour, but Humbled her
Enemies, and tore from them the Resources of their Strength, and the
Supports of their Insolence?
Are the Acquisitions of the War retained by the Peace, so inestimably
valuable, and ought not the Colonies to have some Consideration that were
instrumental in the Successes whence those Acquisitions flowed, and
strained every Nerve in the general Service, to that Degree of Exertion, that
without it, all the Power of Great-Britain, all the amazing Abilities of her
Minister, and all the Discipline, and unparallel’d Bravery of her national
Troops and Seamen, could not have availed beyond meer Defence, if
happily so far? If the War was expensive beyond all former Example, so
were the Successes of it beneficial. If the Expences attending the military
Operations in America, are justly to be charged to the sole Defence of the
Colonies, and no Part of it to the Security of Great-Britain, or to the Views
of extending her Dominions by Conquest, if all the Successes of the War
have been atchieved by the national Arms of Great-Britain ALONE, without
any Assistance, or Co-operation of the Plantations, still ought not the Claim
against the Colonies in Equity, to be mitigated upon Reflection of the
Advantages derived from Them, and of their Contribution to the national

Revenue for a long Course of Years, during which, their Protection put the
British Nation to very little, if any particular Expence?
If moreover, Great-Britain hath an equitable Claim to the Contribution
of the Colonies, it ought to be proportioned to their Circumstances, and
They might, surely, be indulged with discharging it in the most easy, and
satisfactory Manner to Themselves. If Ways and Means convenient, and
conciliating would produce their Contribution, as well as oppressive and
disgusting Exactions, it is neither consistent with Humanity or Policy, to
pursue the latter—A Power may even exist without an actual Exercise of it,
and it indicates as little good Sense as good Nature to exercise it, only that
the Subjects of it may feel the Rod that Rules Them. Moderation may be
observed, and Equity maintained, at the same Time that Superiority is
asserted, and Authority vindicated, whatever the Apprehensions of
Pusillanimity, or the Insolence of Usurpation may suggest.
What is the annual Sum expected from the Colonies—what Proportion
from each—how far do their Abilities extend? These Matters have been,
without doubt, precisely ascertained, or easily may be, at a Time “when the
real, the substantial, the commercial Interests of Great-Britain, are preferred
to every other Consideration, and it is so well known, that the Trade whence
it’s greatest Wealth is derived, and upon which it’s maritime Power is
principally founded, depends upon a wise and proper Use of the Colonies,”
which implies, at least, such an Understanding of their Circumstances, as
must render it extremely easy, to form a reasonable Estimate of their
comparative Wealth, and the Extent of their Abilities. The proportion of
each Colony, being so easily ascertainable at this Period of uncommon
Knowledge of their Affairs, why has the Course observed by former
Ministers, when Supplies have been expected from America, been neglected
by the present? Why was there not the usual Requisition communicated to

the Provincial Assemblies, instead of exacting an uncertain and unequal
Sum from each Colony, by a Law abruptly passed, without any previous
Default of those who are affected by it?—I shall not call it a Law repugnant
to their Genius, cancelling their Charters, infringing the most valuable
Rights and Privileges of British Subjects, derogatory from the Faith and
Honour of Government, unjust and cruel in it’s Principles, rigorous and
oppressive in the Means provided for it’s Execution, and as pernicious in
it’s Consequences to the Mother Country, as injurious to the Colonies in it’s
immediate Operation, but I may call it a rigorous and severe Law. It is in
vain to attempt a Palliation of this useless Severity, (useless I mean to the
Purpose of raising a Revenue) by fallaciously pretending that, as all the
Colonies were to be taxed, and the Authority of each is limited, the
Interposition of the Parliament became necessary, since Nothing can be less
disputable, than that each Colony hath a competent Authority to raise it’s
Proportion, and consequently nothing is more evident, than that all the
Colonies might raise the whole. The Assertion3 that the Colonies would
have paid no Regard to any Requisitions, is rash and unauthoriz’d, and had
the Event actually happened, the Trouble and Loss of Time to the Ministers
in making the Experiment, would not have been considerable or detrimental
to the Nation, and after it’s Failure, an Act of Parliament might still have
been made to compel the Contribution, if the Power which hath been
exercised is defensible upon the Principles of the British Constitution.
A Measure so extreme, could hardly be at once pursued, because the
Ministers did not know what to demand, who have made so many
Regulations in regard to the Colonies, “founded upon Knowledge, formed
with Judgment, and executed with Vigour.” Had the Requisitions been
communicated, I make no Doubt but They would have been entertained
with Respect, and productive of all the Effects that could reasonably have

been expected from Them. A petty American Assembly would not, in
Answer to such Requisitions, have impertinently recommended the
Reduction of exorbitant Salaries, the Abatement of extravagant, and the
Abolition of illegal Perquisites, the Extinction of useless Places, or the
disbanding of undeserving, or ill deserving Pensioners, as a more proper
and beneficial Method of relieving the public Burthens, than a new and
heavy Imposition upon useful and industrious Subjects.
Have great Things been promised for the Ease of the People of
England, and hath a Measure been fallen upon, that, by putting the
Accomplishment of them at a Distance, and keeping Expectation alive, it
may contribute to the Prolongation of a Power, which, in the Interim, will
find sufficient Opportunities to gratify the Views of Ministerial Avarice or
Ambition?
If a Sum had been liquidated, and a precise Demand made, it might,
perhaps, have been shewn, if proportioned to the Circumstances of the
Colonies, to be of no real Consequence to the Nation; and, if above their
Circumstances, that it would, with the Oppression of the Plantations, prove
ruinous to the British Manufactures; but, whilst Matters are thus vague, and
indeterminate, any Attempt to shew that the Stamp Duties will be
inadequate to the promised Relief, distress the Colonies, and consequently
beggar the British Manufacturers, may be obviated by saying, that “the Act
is in the Nature of an Experiment; if inadequate, other Methods may be
superadded; if inconvenient, it may be repealed, as soon as discovered;” and
Hints may be thrown out at the same Time, to cherish the Hopes of the
Nation, that there are the best Grounds to expect the Measure will be
productive of all that can be desired or wished.4
The frugal Republicans of North-America, (if the British Inhabitants
there are to be distinguished by a Nick-Name, because it implies that They

are Enemies to the Government of England, and ought therefore to be
regarded with a jealous Eye) may be allowed, without derogating from the
vast and prodigious knowledge of a Minister, to be acquainted with their
own internal Circumstances better than a Stranger, who must depend upon
Information; and that too, most frequently, of Men not the most eminent for
their Candour, distinguished by their Sagacity, or respectable for their
Integrity. Had Requisitions been made, and the Sum demanded been
equitable, and proportioned to their Circumstances, They could have fallen
upon Ways and Means less oppressive than the Stamp Duties. They have
frequently taxed Themselves: They have tried various Methods of Taxation:
They know, by Experience, the easiest and least expensive.—The Meaning,
or Construction of their Levy-Acts is settled: They can be carried into
Execution, not only at a small Expence, without exhausting a considerable
Part of their Produce by the Multiplication of Officers, and their Support;
but without heavy Pains and grievous Penalties, without Oppression of the
innocent, giving Countenance to Vexation, and Encouragement to profligate
Informers, without the Establishment of arbitrary and distant Courts of
Admiralty.5
The national Debt is heavy, and it is a popular Scheme to draw from
the Colonies a Contribution towards the Relief of the Mother-Country.—
The Manner of effecting it is not carefully attended to, or nicely regarded by
those who expect to receive the Benefit.—The End is so ardently desired,
that, whether the Means might not be more moderate, is not scrupulously
examined by Men, who think Themselves in no Danger of Injury or
Oppression from their Severity. It is affirmed to those who cannot detect the
Fallacy of the Assertion, that Millions have been expended solely in the
Defence of America. They believe it, and thence are easily persuaded that
the Claim of a Contribution from the Colonies is just and equitable, and that

any Measure necessary to secure it, is right and laudable.—It is represented,
that unless the Colonies are stripped of the Trial by Jury, and Courts of
Admiralty are established, in which Judges from England, Strangers,
without Connection or Interest in America, removeable at Pleasure, and
supported by liberal Salaries, are to preside; unless Informers are
encouraged and favoured, and the accused most rigorously dealt by, that the
Tax will be eluded—and these Severities are excus’d on Account of their
supposed Necessity. The Colonies are described to be a numerous,
flourishing, and opulent People:—It is alledged that They contribute to the
national Expence, by Taxes there only the pitiful Sum of 1900l. per Year,
for the Collection of which, an Establishment of Officers, attended with the
Expence of 7600l. per Annum, is necessary.—Upon these Premisses, the
Uneasiness of the Colonies, at being forced to bring more into the common
Stock, appears to be unreasonable, if not rebellious; and They seem rather
to deserve Reprehension and Correction, than Favour and Indulgence.
The Successes of the War were obtained as well by the vigorous
Efforts of the Colonies, as by the Exertion of Great-Britain—The Faith of
Great-Britain hath been engaged in the most solemn Manner, to re-pay the
Colonies the Monies levied by internal Taxations for the Support of the
War.—Is it consistent with that Faith to tax Them towards sinking the Debt
in Part incurred by that Re-payment? The immense Accession of Territory,
and Value of the Acquisitions obtained by the Peace, is the Consequence of
the Successes of the War—The Charge of the War is lessened by the
Advantages resulting from the Peace—The Colonies, for a long Course of
Time, have largely contributed to the public Revenue, and put Great-Britain
to little or no Expence for their Protection.—If it were equitable to draw
from Them a further Contribution, it does not therefore follow, that it is
proper to force it from Them, by the harsh and rigorous Methods

established by the Stamp-Act; an Act unequal and disproportioned to their
Circumstances whom it affects; exempting Opulence, crushing Indigence;
and tearing from a numerous, loyal, and useful People, the Privileges They
had, in their Opinion, earned and merited, and justly held most dear. If They
are really in Debt, the Payment of it hath not been refused, it hath not been
demanded.—If one Subject, grown giddy with sudden Elevation, should, at
any future Period, rashly declare, that the Colonies should be taxed, at all
Events, in the most rigorous Manner; and that Millions of industrious and
useful Subjects should be grievously oppressed, rather than himself depart
from his Character of Pertinacity and Wilfulness, check the Impulse of a
tyrannical Disposition, or foregoe the Gratification of his Vanity, in a
wanton Display of Power, Submission would be an admirable Virtue
indeed, if not the Effect of Impotence.
That the Contribution arising from the Stamp-Duties is disproportioned
to their Circumstances from whom it is exacted, is manifest; for They will
produce in each Colony, a greater, or less Sum, not in Proportion to its
Wealth, but to the Multiplicity of Juridical Forms, the Quantity of vacant
Land, the Frequency of transferring landed Property, the Extent of Paper
Negotiations, the Scarcity of Money, and the Number of Debtors. A larger
Sum will be exacted from a Tobacco-Colony than from Jamaica; and it will
not only be higher in one of the poorest Colonies, and the least able to bear
it, than in the richest; but the principal Part of the Revenue will be drawn
from the poorest Individuals in the poorest Colonies, from Mortgagors,
Obligors, and Defendants. If this be true, does the Act deserve the
Encomium of being a Mode of Taxation the easiest, and the most equal, a
Duty upon Property spread lightly over a great Variety of Subjects, and
heavy upon none?

The Commons of Great-Britain, moreover, in their Capacity of
Representative, not only Give and Grant the Property of the Colonies; but,
in my Construction of the Stamp-Act, (however every Reader may examine
and judge for himself,) Give and Grant also to certain Officers of the
Crown, a Power to tax Them higher still; for these Officers will not, I
presume, be called virtual Representatives too; and what They shall think fit
to levy, by an ingenious Extent of the Fiction, will not be considered as
levied with the Consent of the Colonies—The Instances, I believe, are rare,
in which the Representatives of the People of England have delegated to
Officers of the Crown, the Power of taxing their Constituents, nor hath any
Distinction yet been advanced to prove, that in their Capacity of virtual
Representatives of the Colonies, the House of Commons not having the
same Confidence reposed in Them, ought to proceed upon peculiar Rules.
There was a Statute of Henry VIII, by which, I think, the King’s
Proclamations, with the Consent of the Privy Council, were to operate as
Laws; and another Statute of Ric. II, that the Power of the Two Houses
should be vested in Twelve Lords; but these Acts bear no Resemblance to
the Stamp-Act.
The Stamping Instruments are to be retained in England.—Vellum,
Parchment, and Paper, are to be sent to America, ready stamped.—The first
Commissioner of the Treasury, or the Commissioners, or any Three or more
of Them, are, by the Act, impowered to set any Price upon the Vellum,
Parchment and Paper, and the Payment of that Price is secured and enforced
by the same Pains and Penalties that the Stamp-Duties are.
If the Substitution of an arbitrary Civil Law Court, in the Place of the
legal Judicatories, and that deserved Favourite, the Common-Law-Trial by
Jury, would not justify the Assertion, that the Stamp-Act hath stripped the
Colonies of the Guards and Securities provided by the Constitution against

Oppression in the Execution of Laws, I would much less presume to say,
the vesting in the Commissioners of the Treasury a Power to tax the
Colonies, will amply justify the Assertion, that the Stamp-Act hath not left
Them even the Shadow of a Privilege.—It is indeed something difficult to
imagine how the Order of Democracy, which is as much a Part of the
Constitution, as Monarchy or Aristocracy, can exist when the People are
excluded from a Share in the executing, and a Share in the making of Laws;
but that is not the present Case; and, though I may not be able to answer a
specious Objection, formed upon general Principles, I am not obliged to
adopt it, ’till I am convinced of its Solidity.
A little Examination will find how unfair and deceptive the
Representation is, that the Colonies in North-America, “Two Millions of
British Subjects, an opulent, thriving and commercial People, contribute to
the national Expence, no more than 7 or 800l. per Annum by Taxes raised
there;” for tho’ it should be acknowledged (which I neither admit nor deny,
because I don’t know, nor have an Opportunity of coming at the Fact) that
the Impositions upon the Inhabitants of the Colonies do not raise there, a
greater Sum than hath been stated, it doth not follow that, “the Inhabitants
of the Colonies are indulged at the Expence of Great-Britain, and that the
neediest British Cottager, who out of his scanty Pittance hardly earned,
pays the high Duties of Customs and Excise in the Price of his
Consumptions, has Reason to complain,” if immense Sums are raised upon
the Inhabitants of the Colonies elsewhere.
By such Artifices and Sophistry, is Ignorance misled, Credulity
deceived, and Prejudices excited. Thus Oppression gains the Credit of
Equity, Cruelty passes for Moderation, and Tyranny for Justice, and the
Man who deserves—Reproach, is celebrated by Adulation, and applauded
by Delusion for his Wisdom and patriotic Virtues.

The Truth is, that a vast Revenue arises to the British Nation from
Taxes paid by the Colonies in GREAT-BRITAIN, and even the most ignorant
British Cottager, not imposed upon by infamous Misrepresentation, must
perceive, that it is of no Consequence to his Ease and Relief, whether the
Duties raised upon America are paid there, and thence afterwards remitted
to Great-Britain, or paid at first upon the produce of the Colonies in GreatBritain.
In the Article of Tobacco, for Instance, the Planter pays a Tax upon
that Produce of his Land and Labour consumed in Great-Britain, more than
Six Times the clear Sum received by Him for it, besides the Expences of
Freight, Commission and other Charges, and double Freight, Commission
and Charges upon the Tobacco re-exported, by which the British Merchants,
Mariners and other British Subjects, are supported—a Tax, at least, equal to
what is paid by any Farmer of Great-Britain, possessed of the same Degree
of Property; and moreover the Planter must contribute to the Support of the
expensive internal Government of the Colony, in which He resides.6
Is it objected, that the Duties charged upon Tobacco, fall ultimately
upon the Consumers of this Commodity in the consequential Price set upon
it? Be it so, and let the Principle be established that all Taxes upon a
Commodity, are paid by the Consumers of it, and the Consequence of this
Principle be fairly drawn, and equally applied.
The British Consumers therefore, ultimately pay the high Duties laid
upon Tobacco, in Proportion to the Quantity of that Commodity which
They

consume—The

Colonies

therefore,

in

Proportion

to

their

Consumption of British Manufactures, pay also the high Duties of Customs
and Excise, with which the Manufacturers are charged in the consequential
Price set upon their Consumptions—In their Passage moreover, from the
British Manufacturers to the American Importers, the Commodities go thro’

a great many Hands, by which their Costs are enhanced; the Factors, the
Carriers, the Shop-keepers, the Merchants, the Brokers, the Porters, the
Watermen, the Mariners, and Others, have their respective Profits, from
which They derive their Subsistance, and the Support of their Families, and
are enabled to pay the high Duties of Customs and Excise, in the Price of
their Consumptions.7
The Policy of the late Regulations of the Colonies is of the same
Character with their Justice, and Lenity. The Produce of their Lands, the
Earnings of their Industry, and the Gains of their Commerce Center in
Great-Britain, support the Artificers, the Manufactories, and Navigation of
the Nation, and with Them the British Land-holders too.
Great-Britain had ALL before, and therefore can have no more from
the Colonies; but the Minister, in the pursuit of a “well-digested, consistent,
wise and salutary Plan of Colonization and Government, a Plan founded
upon the Principles of Policy, Commerce and Finance,” chuses to demolish
at one Blow, all their Privileges as they have understood Them, that he may
raise in America, a Part of what was before paid in Great-Britain. But if the
Execution of it, instead of improving the Advantages already possessed,
confirming the Blessings already enjoyed, and promoting the Public
Welfare, should happen to distress the Trade, reduce the Navigation,
impoverish the Manufacturers, and diminish the Value of the Lands in
Great-Britain; should it drive the British Mechanics and Manufacturers to
America, by depriving Them of their best Customers at Home, and force the
Colonies upon Manufactures, they are disabled from purchasing, other
Topics of Eulogy must be discovered by his ingenious Encomiasts, than his
Wisdom or his political Atchievements. Upon such an Event, an American
will have very little Reason to exclaim
O! me infelicem, qui nunc demum intelligo

Ut illa mihi profuerint quæ despexeram,
Et illa, quæ laudaram, quantum Luctus habuerint!
The Right of Exemption from all Taxes without their Consent, the
Colonies claim as British Subjects. They derive this Right from the
Common Law, which their Charters have declared and confirmed, and They
conceive that when stripped of this Right, whether by Prerogative or by any
other Power, they are at the same Time deprived of every Privilege
distinguishing Free-Men from Slaves.
On the other Hand, They acknowledge Themselves to be subordinate
to the Mother Country, and that the Authority vested in the supreme
Council of the Nation, may be justly exercised to support and preserve that
Subordination.
Great and just Encomiums have been bestow’d upon the Constitution
of England, and their Representative is deservedly the Favourite of the
Inhabitants in Britain. But it is not because the supreme Council is called
Parliament, that They boast of their Constitution of Government; for there
is no particular magical Influence from the Combination of the Letters
which form the Word; it is because They have a Share in that Council, that
They appoint the Members who constitute one Branch of it, whose Duty
and Interest it is to consult their Benefit, and to assert their Rights, and who
are vested with an Authority, to prevent any Measures taking Effect
dangerous to their Liberties, or injurious to their Properties.
But the Inhabitants in the Colonies have no Share in this great Council.
None of the Members of it are, or can be of their Appointment, or in any
Respect dependant upon Them. There is no immediate Connection, on the
Contrary, there may be an Opposition of Interest; how puerile then is the
Declamation, “what will become of the Colonies Birthright, and the
glorious Securities which their Forefathers handed down to Them, if the

Authority of the British Parliament to impose Taxes upon Them should be
given up? To deny the Authority of the British Legislature, is to surrender
all Claim to a Share in it’s Councils, and if this were the Tenor of their
Charters, a Grant more insidious or replete with Mischief, could not be
imagined, a Forfeiture of their Rights would be couched under the
Appearance of Privilege, &c.”
We claim an Exemption from all Parliamentary Impositions, that We
may enjoy those Securities of our Rights and Properties, which We are
entitled to by the Constitution. For those Securities are derived to the
Subject from the Principle that he is not to be taxed without his own
Consent, and an Inhabitant in America can give his Consent in no other
Manner than in Assembly. It is in the Councils that exist there, and there
only, that he hath a Share, and whilst He enjoys it, his Rights and Privileges
are as well secured as any Elector’s in England, who hath a Share in the
national Councils there; for the Words Parliament and Assembly are in this
Respect, only different Terms to express the same Thing.
But it is argued, that “if the common Law of England, is to be brought,
as justifying a Claim of Exemption in any Subject of Great-Britain from a
Parliamentary Tax, it will plead against a Tax imposed by a Provincial
Assembly; for as all the Colony Assemblies derive their Authority from the
meer Grant of the Crown only, it might be urged that any Tax imposed by
Them, is imposed by Authority of the Prerogative of the Crown, and not by
full Consent of Parliament. That if this Right in the Crown, is
acknowledged to exempt the Subject from the jurisdiction of Parliament in
the Case of Taxation, its Power to dispense with Acts of Parliament, or to
deprive the same Subject of the Benefit of the Common Law, can’t be
denied.”

One would be inclined to suspect that it is supposed, something else
than Reason, may on this Occasion conduce to Persuasion.
The English Subjects, who left their native Country to settle in the
Wilderness of America, had the Privileges of other Englishmen. They knew
their Value, and were desirous of having Them perpetuated to their
Posterity. They were aware that, as their Consent whilst They should reside
in America, could neither be ask’d nor regularly given in the national
Legislature, and that if They were to be bound by Laws without Restriction,
affecting the Property They should earn by the utmost Hazard and Fatigue,
They would lose every other Privilege which They had enjoyed in their
native Country, and become meer Tenants at Will dependant upon the
Moderation of their Lords and Masters, without any other Security—That
as their Settlement was to be made under the Protection of the English
Government, They knew, that in Consequence of their Relation to the
Mother-Country, They and their Posterity would be subordinate to the
supreme national Council, and expected that Obedience and Protection
would be considered as reciprocal Duties.
Considering Themselves, and being considered in this Light, They
entered into a Compact with the Crown, the Basis of which was, That their
Privileges as English Subjects, should be effectually secured to Themselves,
and transmitted to their Posterity. And as for this Purpose, precise
Declarations and Provisions formed upon the Principles, and according to
the Spirit of the English Constitution were necessary; CHARTERS were
accordingly framed and conferred by the Crown, and accepted by the
Settlers, by which all the Doubts and Inconveniencies which might have
arisen from the Application of general Principles to a new Subject, were
prevented.

By these Charters, founded upon the unalienable Rights of the Subject,
and upon the most sacred Compact, the Colonies claim a Right of
Exemption from Taxes not imposed with their Consent.—They claim it
upon the Principles of the Constitution, as once English, and now British
Subjects, upon Principles on which their Compact with the Crown was
originally founded.
The Origin of other Governments is covered by the Veil of Antiquity,
and is differently traced by the Fancies of different Men; but, of the
Colonies, the Evidence of it is as clear and unequivocal as of any other
Fact.
By these declaratory Charters the Inhabitants of the Colonies claim an
Exemption from all Taxes not imposed by their own Consent, and to infer
from their Objection to a Taxation, to which their Consent is not, nor can be
given, that They are setting up a Right in the Crown to dispense with Acts of
Parliament, and to deprive the British Subjects in America of the Benefits of
the Common Law, is so extremely absurd, that I should be at a Loss to
account for the Appearance of so strange an Argument, were I not apprized
of the unworthy Arts employed by the Enemies of the Colonies to excite
strong Prejudices against Them in the Minds of their Brethren at Home, and
what gross Incongruities prejudiced Men are wont to adopt.
Tho’ I am persuaded that this Reasoning hath already been sufficiently
refuted, and that no sensible and dispassionate Man can perceive any Force
in it, yet I can’t help remarking, that it is grounded upon a Principle, which,
if it were possible for the Examiner to establish it, would entitle him to the
Applause of the Inhabitants in Great-Britain, as little as to the Thanks of the
Colonies.
From what Source do the Peers of England derive their Dignity, and
the Share They have in the British Legislature? Are there no Places in

England that derive their Power of chusing Members of Parliament from
royal Charters? Will this Writer argue, that the Crown may, by Prerogative,
tax the Inhabitants of Great-Britain, because the Peers of England, and
some Representatives of the People, exercise a legislative Authority under
Royal Patents and Charters? It must be admitted that all the Members of the
House of Commons are freely chosen by the People, and are not afterwards
subject to any Influence of the Crown or the Ministry: And are not the
Members of the Lower Houses of Assembly as freely chosen also by the
People; and, in Fact, as independent as the Members of the House of
Commons? If the Truth were confessed, the Objection would not be, that
the Colonies are too dependent upon the Crown, or that their Claim of
Exemption from all Taxes, not imposed by their own Consent, is founded
upon a Principle leading to Slavery. At one Time, the North-Americans are
called Republicans; at another, the Assertors of Despotism. What a strange
Animal must a North-American appear to be from these Representations to
the Generality of English Readers, who have never had an Opportunity to
admire, that He may be neither black, nor tawny, may speak the English
Language, and, in other Respects, seem, for all the World, like one of
Them!
“The Common Law, the great Charter, the Bill of Rights,” are so far
from “declaring, with one Voice, that the Inhabitants of the Colonies shall
be taxed by no other Authority than that of the British Parliament,” that
They prove the contrary; for the Principle of the Common Law is, that no
Part of their Property shall be drawn from British Subjects, without their
Consent, given by those whom They depute to represent Them; and this
Principle is enforced by the Declaration of the GREAT CHARTER, and the
Bill of Rights, neither the one nor the other, introducing any new Privilege.
In Great-Britain, the Consent of the People is given by the House of

Commons, and, as Money had been levied there for the Use of the Crown,
by Pretence of Prerogative, without their Consent, it was properly declared
at the Revolution, in Support of the Constitution, and in Vindication of the
People’s Rights, that the levying of Money, by Pretence of Prerogative,
without Grant of Parliament, i. e. without their Consent who are to pay it, is
illegal, which Declaration was most suitable to the Occasion, and
effectually establishes the very Principle contended for by the Colonies.
The Word Parliament, having been made use of, the Letter of the
Declaration is adhered to, and the Consequence drawn, that no British
Subject can be legally taxed, but by the Authority of the British Parliament,
against the Spirit and Principle of the Declaration, which was aimed only to
check and restrain the Prerogative, and to establish the Necessity of
obtaining the Consent of those on whom Taxes were to be levied. Is not this
a new Kind of Logic, to infer from Declarations and Claims, founded upon
the necessary and essential Principle of a free Government, that the People
ought not to be taxed without their Consent, that therefore the Colonies
ought to be taxed by an Authority, in which their Consent is not, nor can be
concerned; or, in other Words, to draw an Inference from a Declaration or
Claim of Privilege, subversive of the very Principle upon which the
Privilege is founded? How aukwardly are the Principles of the Revolution
applied by some Men! What Astonishment would the Promoters of that
glorious Measure, those Patrons and Friends of Liberty, did They now tread
the Stage of this World, express, that a Word, by which They meant to assert
the Privileges of the Subject, and restrain despotic Power, should be relied
upon to demolish the very Principle by which Themselves were animated,
and after all their Pains and Hazards to establish the generous Sentiments of
Liberty, that those who feel and enjoy the Blessings of their successful

Struggles, should not be able to raise a Thought beyond the Ideas affixed to
systematic Terms.
It was declared also by the Bill of Rights, that the Elections of
Members of Parliment ought to be free, and the Common Law laid down
the same Rule before, which is as applicable to the Election of the
Representatives of the Colonies, as of the Commons of Great-Britain. But
with the Help of the Examiner’s Logic, it might be proved from the Letter
of the Bill of Rights, that the Elections only of Members of Parliament
ought to be free; for the Freedom expressed in the Bill of Rights, is as much
attached to Elections of Members of Parliament, as the Authority to grant
Money is to the British Parliament, and if the Declaration in the one Case
implies a Negative, there is the like Implication in the other. If, moreover,
the Common Law, the great Charter, and the Bill of Rights, do really, as the
Examiner asserts, with one Voice declare, that the Inhabitants of the
Colonies ought to be taxed only by the British Parliament, it is not
consistent with that Character of Vigilance, and Jealousy of their Power,
commonly ascribed to the British Parliament, that, from their first regular
Settlement to the Reign of Geo. III, the American Assemblies should not
only have been suffered, without any Animadversion, without one Resolve,
or even a single Motion to restrain Them, to encroach upon the Jurisdiction
and Authority of the British Parliament; but that the Parliament should
never before the late Stamp-Act, in one Instance, have imposed an internal
Tax upon the Colonies for the single Purpose of Revenue, and that, even
when Acts of Assembly passed in Consequence of Ministerial inforced by
Royal Requisitions have been laid before Them, They should be so far from
objecting to their Validity, as actually to recognize the Authority of the
Provincial Legislatures, and upon that Foundation superstruct their own
Resolves and Acts.

But tho’ it hath been admitted, that the Stamp-Act is the first Statute
that hath imposed an internal Tax upon the Colonies for the single Purpose
of Revenue, yet the Advocates for that Law contend, that there are many
Instances of the Parliament’s exercising a supreme legislative Authority
over the Colonies, and actually imposing internal Taxes upon their
Properties—that the Duties upon any Exports or Imports are internal Taxes
—That an Impost on a foreign Commodity is as much an internal Tax, as a
Duty upon any Production of the Plantations—That no Distinction can be
supported between one Kind of Tax and another, an Authority to impose the
one extending to the other.
If these Things are really as represented by the Advocates for the
Stamp Act, why did the Chancellor of the Exchequer make it a Question for
the Consideration of the House of Commons, whether the Parliament could
impose an internal Tax in the Colonies or not, for the single Purpose of
Revenue?8
It appears to me, that there is a clear and necessary Distinction
between an Act imposing a Tax for the single Purpose of Revenue, and
those Acts which have been made for the Regulation of Trade, and have
produced some Revenue in Consequence of their Effect and Operation as
Regulations of Trade.
The Colonies claim the Privileges of British Subjects—It has been
proved to be inconsistent with those Privileges, to tax Them without their
own Consent, and it hath been demonstrated that a Tax imposed by
Parliament, is a Tax without their Consent.
The Subordination of the Colonies, and the Authority of the Parliament
to preserve it, have been fully acknowledged. Not only the Welfare, but
perhaps the Existence of the Mother Country, as an independent Kingdom,
may depend upon her Trade and Navigation, and these so far upon her

Intercourse with the Colonies, that, if this should be neglected, there would
soon be an End to that Commerce, whence her greatest Wealth is derived,
and upon which her maritime Power is principally founded. From these
Considerations, the Right of the British Parliament to regulate the Trade of
the Colonies, may be justly deduced; a Denial of it would contradict the
Admission of the Subordination, and of the Authority to preserve it,
resulting from the Nature of the Relation between the Mother Country and
her Colonies. It is a common, and frequently the most proper Method to
regulate Trade by Duties on Imports and Exports. The Authority of the
Mother Country to regulate the Trade of the Colonies, being
unquestionable, what Regulations are the most proper, are to be of Course
submitted to the Determination of the Parliament; and, if an incidental
Revenue, should be produced by such Regulations; these are not therefore
unwarrantable.
A Right to impose an internal Tax on the Colonies, without their
Consent for the single Purpose of Revenue, is denied, a Right to regulate
their Trade without their Consent is admitted. The Imposition of a Duty,
may, in some Instances, be the proper Regulation. If the Claims of the
Mother Country and the Colonies should seem on such an Occasion to
interfere, and the Point of Right to be doubtful, (which I take to be
otherwise) it is easy to guess that the Determination will be on the Side of
Power, and that the Inferior will be constrained to submit.9
The Writer on the Regulations lately made with Respect to the
Colonies, who is said to have been well informed, asserts a Fact, which
indisputably proves, that the Impositions mentioned, were only Regulations
of Trade, and can, with no kind of Propriety, be considered in any other
Light. The Fact he asserts, is, that “the whole Remittance from all the Taxes
in the Colonies, at an Average of Thirty Years, has not amounted to 1900l. a

Year, and in that Sum, 7 or 8ool. per Annum only, have been remitted from
North-America; and that the Establishment of Officers, necessary to collect
that Revenue, amounts to 7600l. per Annum.”
It would be ridiculous indeed to suppose, that the Parliament would
raise a Revenue by Taxes in the Colonies to defray Part of the national
Expence, the Collection of which Taxes would increase that Expence to a
Sum more than three Times the Amount of the Revenue; but, the
Impositions being considered in their true Light, as Regulations of Trade,
the Expence arising from an Establishment necessary to carry Them into
Execution, is so far from being ridiculous, that it may be wisely incurred.
The Author of the Claim of the Colonies, &c. gives (as hath been
observed) the Epithets of unjust and partial, to a Tax which should be
imposed upon the Non-Electors, only in Britain; and, in that very Instance,
proves, that a Tax upon the Non-Electors in the Colonies, is more unjust
and partial, and yet undertakes to defend the Justice of it; and the Writer on
the Regulations of the Colonies declares, that it is in vain to call the Acts
He has cited as Precedents, by the Name of mere Regulations,
notwithstanding He hath irrefragably proved, that They are ridiculous, if
considered in any other Light. (See The Regulation of the Colonies, &c.
Pages 234, 202–3, and The Claim of the Colonies, &c. Page 28, 29, 30.)10
Though I conceive that the Distinction which hath been suggested, is
sufficiently evident, and that the Argument from Precedents hath been
refuted, yet, as there have been two or three Instances particularly enforced
and relied upon, I must beg the Reader’s Patience whilst I examine Them
separately, without undertaking the Task to remove every Incongruity to be
found in the Writings of the Enemies of America on this Occasion; for it
would require an Hercules to cleanse the Stable.

The 5th Geo. II, it is alledged, “abrogates so much of the Common
Law as relates to Descents of Freeholds in America, takes from the Son the
Right of Inheritance in the Lands the Crown had granted to the Father, and
his Heirs in absolute Fee, makes them Assets, and applies Them to the
Payment of Debts and Accounts contracted by the Father without the
Participation of the Son; it sets aside the Sort of Evidence required by the
Common Law, and establish’d by every Court of Justice in America, in
Proof of a Debt, and enjoins the Admission of an ex Parte Affidavit. The
Power of Parliament having been exercised to take away the Lands of the
People in America, the most sacred Part of any Man’s Property, and
disposing of Them for the Use of private Persons Inhabitants of GreatBritain, who can question,” says the Examiner, “the Parliament’s Right to
take away a small Part of the Products of those Lands, and apply it to the
public Service?”
It is very observable, that in applying this Statute, a Language is made
use of, which gives the Idea of Violence; and it must be confessed, that
great Aggravation of Features, and strong Colouring, were necessary, to
make it in any Degree resemble the Impositions of the Stamp-Act.
It would be useless, as well as tedious, to point out every
Misrepresentation in this Application, since that will be effectually done, by
briefly shewing the Effect of the 5th Geo. II, and suggesting the Occasion
of making that Statute.
Lands, Negroes, &c. in the Plantations, are made Assets for the
Satisfaction of all Debts owing to his Majesty, or any of his Subjects, in like
Manner as Real Estates are, by the Law of England liable to the Satisfaction
of Debts due by Specialty.
If the Creditor resides in Great-Britain, the Affidavits of his Witnesses
taken there, are to be allowed as Evidence, and to have the same Force their

Testimony would have, if given, vivâ Voce, in open Court.
The Evidence mentioned in the Statute, prevailed in most, if not all the
Colonies, before the Statute, and Lands were also liable to the Satisfaction
of all Debts in most Instances, by the Method practised also in the Court of
Chancery in England, of marshalling Assets. In some of the Colonies,
without this Circuity, Lands were immediately liable to simple Contract
Debts.
Independent of the Statute, when the Creditor obtains a Judgment
against his Debtor, all his Lands, &c. over which he has a disposing Power,
are liable, and, since the Statute, only such Lands, &c. are Assets, as the
Debtor had a Power to dispose of. It appears then, that all the Effect of the
Statute on this Head, is to subject Real Estates to the Payment of Debts
after the Death of the Debtor, (for the most Part, the Case before the
Statute) which might have been made Subject before his Death.
In many of the Colonies, the provincial Creditors of deceased Debtors,
were preferred to the British, in the same Degree, by Acts of Assembly
which carried the Appearance of Partiality; tho’ in Fact, the Effect of the
Laws of England gave Rise to Them; for, upon Bankruptcies in GreatBritain, the Steps required by the Statutes to entitle Creditors to a
Satisfaction, effectually exclude Colony Creditors in most Cases, and their
Distance, when their Debtors die in Great-Britain, where Colony Creditors
have not standing Agents as the Merchants have in the Plantations, and
there happens a Deficiency of Assets, shuts them out likewise from all
Chance of Satisfaction in the usual Scramble among Creditors for the
Debtor’s Estate on such Events.
In some of the Colonies They changed, by Acts of Assembly, certain
Species of personal Property, e. g. Negroes, into the Nature of real Estates,
by making Them descendible; and, by this Alteration of the Common Law,

and Confusion of the former Distinction of Property, very considerably
diminished the personal Fund, liable to all Debts.
As these Circumstances were represented and believed to be great
Discouragements to the Trade of the Mother Country, after repeated
Requisitions to provide a Remedy in the Colonies, in which the Grievance
was most sensibly felt, had been disregarded, the Statute was finally made.
This was, without Doubt, a Subject upon which the Superintendence of
the Mother-Country might be justly exercised; it being relative to her Trade
and Navigation, upon which her Wealth and her Power depend, and the
Preservation of her Superiority, and the Subordination of the Colonies, are
secured, and therefore is comprehended in the Distinction.
After citing, and applying this Statute, the Examiner takes Occasion to
insult a Gentleman of a most amiable and respectable Character, because he
presumed, it seems, to question the Universality of Parliamentary Power,
and appears to be so totally occupied in the Business of Defamation, as not
to be aware of his running into the most egregious Inconsistencies. If the
Examiner is a Lawyer, he has betray’d the most shameful Ignorance; if an
Agent, the most infamous Unfaithfulness. Had the American Chief Justice
acted in England, as too many of his Countrymen have done—Had He paid
his Court to Power, by mean Compliances, and endeavoured to recommend
Himself, by inventing Accusations against the Colonies, by representing the
Inhabitants in Them, as a refractory, disloyal, and rebellious People, and by
proposing Schemes for their Depression—Had He not firmly maintained his
Character of Honour and Probity, we should not have seen this
Impeachment of his Understanding; but he left the Task of Prostitution to
the Man of sordid Views,
Ille superbos Aditus Regum,
Durasque fores, expers Somni

Colat—
“Had the Colonies,” says the Examiner, “agreed to the Imposition of
the Stamp-Duties, a Precedent would have been established for their being
consulted, before any Imposition upon Them by Parliament would hereafter
take Place.” He intimates that They were advised by some of their Agents
to take this Course: If such Advice hath been given, it was weak or
insidious, and the Agents, who recommended the Measure, ought to be
removed for their Incapacity or their Treachery.
How would the Precedent have been established, or, if it had, what
would have been the Advantage? This Conduct would have admitted, that
the Colonies might be taxed at any Time, and in any Manner, without their
Consent; and consequently, would at once have been an effectual Surrender
of all their Privileges as British Subjects.
If Precedents were to be regarded, when a Tax in America, for the
single Purpose of Revenue is required, they are not wanting. Upon such
Occasions, the Course hath always, and uniformly been, ’till the Imposition
of the Stamp-Duties, to transmit Requisitions to the Colonies; and, if the
Instance cited by the Examiner, is, in any Degree pertinent, he has shewn in
his Appendix, that the Method of Requisition was in that pursued; for, the
Lords of Trade, in their Report, expressly mention the Refusal of the
Colonies to comply with the Requisitions transmitted to them, to remove
the Grievance complained of.
The Clause in the Mutiny Act during the late War is also relied upon,
but with how much Propriety, few Words will evince.
The Acts of Assembly of each Colony, could have no obligatory Force
beyond the Limits of each; but the Service of the Colony Troops, was not
confined within the same Colony in which They were raised; it is therefore
evident that the Provincial Legislatures, had not an Authority adequate to

the great Object of the military Operations in America, which was not
merely the Defence of the Plantations, by Measures executed within their
Boundaries, but the Enemy was attacked in his own Country, and for this
Purpose the British and American Troops acted conjunctly. On this
Occasion it was not only convenient, that the Troops employed in the same
Service, should be subject to the same Discipline, but it was indispensably
necessary that this Discipline should be established by Act of Parliament,
the Authority of the Provincial Legislatures being deemed to be
incompetent. And it is to be remarked, moreover, that the Provincial Troops
were raised and paid by the Colonies, and that it was in the Power of their
Assemblies, a Power exercised by some of Them, to disband or reduce
Them when They pleased, and therefore their supporting and keeping them
up, was an effectual Consent to the Act of Parliament; but as hath been
shewn, an internal Tax may be as compleatly and adequately laid in every
Colony, by the Authority of the respective Assemblies, as by the British
Parliament, and therefore there is not the same Necessity for the
Interposition of the Mother Country in this, as in the other Instance, and the
Colonies with Reference to the Stamp-Act, are not called upon to do any
Act expressive of their Assent to it, nor is it in their Power to hinder it’s
taking Effect in the fullest Extent.
The Act for the Establishment of a Post-Office in the Colonies (9
Anne, c. 10,) comes the nearest to the Subject of any Regulation that hath
been mentioned; but yet it is materially distinguishable from the Stamp Act.
For the same Reason that an Act of Parliament was necessary to secure the
Discipline of the Provincial Troops, acting in Conjunction with the British
Forces during the late War, the Authority of Parliament might be proper for
the general Establishment of a regular Post-Office, for as the Laws of each
Colony are in their Operation confined within the Limits of each,

prohibitory and compulsive Clauses to inforce a general Observance,
without which the Establishment would fail, might be eluded. If a Man
should maliciously give a Wound in one Colony, and the wounded Person
die in another, the Offender could not be convicted of Murder, because the
whole Fact constituting that Crime, would not be cognizable in the Colony
where the Wound was given, or the Death happened; and the same Principle
is applicable to every other inferior Offence, and intimates in what Manner
prohibitory Clauses might be evaded. This Matter therefore of the PostOffice, may be referred to the general Superintending Authority of the
Mother-Country, the Power of the Provincial Legislatures being too stinted
to reach it. In this View, and upon the Consideration of the general
Convenience and Accommodation arising from the Establishment, the
People of America have not complained of it, but if this Instance were more
pertinent than it is, it would only prove what hath been too often proved
before—When Men do not suspect any Designs to invade their Rights, and
subdolous Steps taken to that End, are productive of immediate
Convenience without pointing out their destructive Tendency, They are
frequently involved in Ruin before they are aware of Danger, or that the
Conduct flowing from the Negligence of innocent Intentions, may afford an
Handle to Men of different Dispositions, for the Commission of Oppression
—Of the Truth of these Observations the Histories of all People who have
once been blessed with Freedom, and have lost it, exhibit abundant
Examples.
When Instances are urged as an authoritative Reason for adopting a
new Measure, They are proved to be more important from this Use of
Them, and ought therefore to be reviewed with Accuracy, and canvassed
with Strictness. What is proposed ought to be incorporated with what hath
been done, and the Result of both stated and considered as a substantive

original Question, and if the Measure proposed is incompatible with the
constitutional Rights of the Subject, it is so far from being a rational
Argument, that Consistency requires an Adoption of the proposed Measure,
that, on the contrary, it suggests the strongest Motive for abolishing the
Precedent; when therefore an Instance of Deviation from the Constitution is
pressed as a Reason for the Establishment of a Measure striking at the very
Root of all Liberty; tho’ the Argument is inconclusive, it ought to be useful.
Wherefore if a sufficient Answer were not given to the Argument
drawn from Precedents, by shewing that none of the Instances adduced are
applicable, I should have very little Difficulty in denying the Justice of the
Principle on which it is founded. What hath been done, if wrongful, confers
no Right to repeat it. To justify Oppression and Outrage, by Instances of
their Commission, is a Kind of Argument which never can produce
Conviction, tho’ it may their Acquiescence, whom the Terror of greater
Evils may restrain from resisting, and thus the Despotism of the East may
be supported, and the natural Rights of Mankind be trampled under Feet.
The Question of Right, therefore, doth not depend upon Precedents, but on
the Principles of the Constitution, and hath been put upon it’s proper Point
already discussed, whether the Colonies are represented or not, in
Parliament.
As the Name of Hampden occurred to the Examiner in his Design of
casting an oblique Reflection upon the Colonies, it is surprising he did not
recollect, that very numerous Precedents have been applied in the Defence
of an arbitrary and oppressive Proceeding, destructive of the essential
Principle of English Liberty. But tho’ meer Acts of Power prove no Right,
yet the real Opinion entertained of it, may be inferred from Forbearance; for
Mankind are generally so fond of Power, that they are oftener tempted to
exercise it beyond the Limits of Justice, than induced to set Bounds to it

from the pure Consideration of the Rectitude of Forbearance. Wherefore if I
had deny’d the Principle of this Kind of Reasoning, without shewing the
Defects of the artificial painted Precedents which have been produced, I
might still very consistently urge, that, the repeated and uniform
Requisitions of the English Ministers, as often as Occasions for the single
Purpose of Revenue have happened, transmitted to the Colonies to tax
Themselves by Provincial Acts, and the Acts of Parliament regulating the
Trade of the Plantations, as well as of Ireland, without one Instance, before
the Stamp-Act of a Tax imposed by Parliament upon either, for the unmixed
Purpose of Revenue prove, that the Imposition of a Tax upon them without
their Consent, hath constantly been held to be inconsistent with their
Constitutional Rights and Privileges. I have joined Ireland with the
Colonies, and presume it will hardly be contended that Ireland, over which
the Courts of Justice in England have a superintendant Power, is not, at
least, as subject to Great-Britain as the Colonies are.
A most extraordinary Reason hath been given, why the Method of
Requisition would have been improper, viz. that “the Sums raised must be
paid into the Exchequer, and if levied by the Provincial Assemblies, the
Parliament would have no Right to enquire into the Expenditure of them.”
This is so extremely futile, that it would be almost absurd to bestow a
serious Refutation upon it.
Why must the Sums raised be paid into the Exchequer? If the Intention
is to apply them in the Colonies to any internal Purpose, why must they be
remitted to Great-Britain? If Armies are to be kept up in America, to defend
the Colonies against Themselves, (for it can hardly be imagined that Troops
are necessary for their Protection against any foreign Enemy) or are to be
employed in the national Service of Cropping the Ears, and Slitting the
Nostrils of the Civil Magistrates, as Marks of Distinction,11 why must the

Money be paid into the Exchequer? Or, if it should be paid into the
Exchequer, in order to be applied towards sinking the national Debt, why
might not the Parliament enquire into the Application of it? Does the
Examiner, in his Idea of the Parliament, figure to himself a Monster with an
Hand that can reach to the utmost Verge of the British Dominions, and
clutch and crush Millions of Subjects at a Gripe; but, when the Object is
near, apt to be rendered by some magical Influence, so short, and so feeble,
as not to be able to reach the Exchequer, or to squeeze the Chancellor of it?
We are assured that there never can be any irregular “Attempts of the
Prerogative upon our Rights, whilst we are blessed with a Prince of the
glorious Line of Brunswick upon the Throne of Great-Britain.” I have all
the Confidence in the excellent Dispositions of our present most gracious
Sovereign that an Englishman ought to have, but I can’t penetrate into
Futurity; and, as the Examiner hath not yet established the Character of a
Prophet, I must consider this Assertion rather as a curious Specimen of LipLoyalty, I will not call it extravagant Adulation, than as a sober
Recommendation, to surrender all those Guards and Securities of Liberty,
which the Constitution of a Free Government hath provided; but, if the
British Americans should ever be reduced to the unhappy Necessity of
giving up their Natural Rights, and their Civil Principles, I believe They
would as soon make the Surrender to a Prince of the Line of Brunswick, as
to any other Mortal, or Number of Mortals, in the Universe.
We have seen too a Piece in some of our late News-Papers, all
bedawbed with the Lace of Compliment—There is no End to human
Ambition! It is perpetually restless, and pushing forward. If a little P—ct—
r12 is raised to the Title of Excellency, and the Rank of a Kind of Viceroy,
there is still a Summit beyond the Eminence to which he hath been
elevated, that he is sollicitous to gain.

It hath been truly said, that “it will be no easy Task to persuade the
Americans to forsake the Culture of their Lands, to leave the Ways their
Fathers trod, and in which Themselves were trained, to drop a Business
they already understand, in which they have had long Experience, and by
which their Families have thriven, to change all their Habits of Thinking,
and their Manner of Life, in order to apply to Arts which they do not know,
or know but imperfectly, and that where Estates may be easily raised by
mere Tillage, the Temptations to Manufacture are wanting, and Men, who
can depend upon their Industry alone, will not have Recourse to Arts for
Subsistence.” But that which Persuasion might not effect, and to which
peculiar Circumstances might be adverse, Necessity, and an Alteration of
those Circumstances, may accomplish. When the Alternative is proposed,
and the one Part of it assures Success, and a comfortable Support by a
moderate Application of Industry, familiarized by Use, and rendered easy
by Practice; and the other affording only an Experiment of precarious Issue,
calling for an Application unexperienced and dreaded, attended with
Perplexity, and productive of irksome Anxiety, the Generality of Mankind
would not hesitate in chusing the former. But, though it would gain the
Preference of Choice, yet, if the Alternative is taken away, and Choice
yields to Necessity, the Enterprizing will form Projects, the Judicious
improve, the Industrious execute them. Success, in one Instance, will
animate the timid to make Trial of the Means which have succeeded under
the Direction of others, stimulate the Phlegmatic, and rouse the Indolent—
Should the Necessity after a little Time, cease, new Habits may become as
strong as the old, and the Alternative would therefore be altered, the Choice
be an Act of Deliberation, rather than of blind Impulse; old Prejudices
would be greatly abated, if not extinguish’d, new Attachments, perhaps, be
formed. From this Change, different Consequences may be conjectured or

foretold, and perhaps the most Confident might be disappointed by the
Event. It is not so difficult for Men to strike into new Employments and
Methods of Life, when impelled by the Urgency of Distress, nor so easy to
call them back to their old Manner of Life, and divert them from new
Pursuits experienced to be profitable, and productive of the best Security
against Oppression, as some seem to apprehend.
It is not contended that the Colonies ought to be indulged in a general
Liberty of Exporting and Importing every Thing in what Manner they
please, but, since they are hindered from making all the Advantages they
might do, and what Advantages might they not make, if under no Checks?
They have a good Plea against all Rigour and Severity, not absolutely
necessary. That British Manufactures come dearer, and not so good in
Quality to America, as formerly, is a very general Complaint, and what
Effect it may have, should they still grow dearer and worse in Quality, or
the Colonies be rendered less able to consume them, is a Consideration
which concerns Great-Britain, at least as much as the Colonies. An increase
of Price, and falling in the Goodness of Quality, is the usual Effect of
Monopolies; there is no Danger of Foreigners taking Advantage of this
Circumstance in America, whatever they may do in other Countries; but the
Industry it may give Rise to in America, when other Circumstances concur,
is not difficult to be foreseen.
It must be acknowledged, that the Balance of Trade between GreatBritain and her Colonies, is considerably against the latter, and that no Gold
or Silver Mines have yet been discovered in the old American Settlements,
or among the Treasures of the new Acquisitions. How then is this Balance
to be discharged? The former Trade of the Colonies, which enabled them to
keep up their Credit with Great-Britain, by applying the Balance they
gained against Foreigners, is now so fettered with Difficulties, as to be

almost prohibited. In order therefore to reduce the Balance against them
upon the Trade between the Colonies and Great-Britain, this Trade must be
contracted, so as to bring the Scales to an Equilibrium, or a Debt will be
incurred that can’t be paid off, which will distress the Creditor as well as
the Debtor, by the Insolvency of the latter. The Income also of the Colonies,
which was before invested in their Trade, will be diminished in Proportion
to the Produce of the Stamp-Act, and therefore the Amount of that Produce
must be drawn out, which will create a further Reduction of the Trade.
I confess that I am one of those who do not perceive the Policy in
laying Difficulties and Obstructions upon the gainful Trade of the Colonies
with Foreigners, or that it even makes any real Difference to the English
Nation, whether the Merchants who carry it on with Commodities GreatBritain will not purchase, reside in Philadelphia, New-York or Boston,
London, Bristol, or Liverpool, when the Balance gained by the American
Merchant in the Pursuit of that Trade centers in Great-Britain, and is
applied to the Discharge of a Debt contracted by the Consumption of British
Manufactures in the Colonies, and in this to the Support of the national
Expence.
If in Consequence of the Obstructions, or Regulations as they are
called, of their Commerce, and the Imposition of Taxes upon their
Properties, the Colonies should only be driven to observe the strictest
Maxims of Frugality, the Consequence would rather be disagreeable than
hurtful—Should they be forced to use new Methods of Industry, and to have
Recourse to Arts for a Supply of Necessaries, the Difficulty in Succeeding
would prove less than the Apprehension of Miscarrying, and the Benefit
greater than the Hope of it. There are few People of the highest, and even of
the middle Rank, but would upon a strict Scrutiny into their ordinary
Disbursements, discover some Articles that would admit of Defalcation.

A prudent Man, constrained to abridge his Outgoings, will consider
what Articles of Expence may be retrenched or given up, without Distress
or Discomfort, and if, after this saving, he still finds that his Expences
exceed his Income, he will then consider of what Articles he can provide a
Supply by the Application of domestic Industry, or whether some tolerable
Substitute may not be fallen upon to answer the Purpose of what he can
neither buy, nor hath Skill or Ability to fabricate. He will reflect that the
Expedient which is at first but an indifferent Shift, Use and Experience will
improve into Convenience, that Practice will confer Knowledge and Skill,
and these Facility and Satisfaction, and tho’ the Progress should be slow
and gradual, Habit will grow with it, and produce Reconcilement and
Content.
What are called in North-America, Luxuries, ought for the most Part to
be ranked among the Comforts and Decencies of Life, but these will not be
relinquished, if a Supply of Necessaries may be provided by domestic
Industry—For Food, thank GOD, They do not, and for Raiment They need
not, depend upon Great-Britain.
Any thin Covering in the Summer to preserve Decency, and substantial
Cloathing in the Winter to repel the Cold, are sufficient for domestic
Servants and Labourers, and these may be provided without any Remora to
the Business of Tillage, for there are many Intervals in which it is
suspended. There are Times too, when the Employment is so slight as to be
rather a moderate Exercise, than a laborious Task, when the Work that is
done might be performed by half the Number of Labourers without
excessive Exertion, or exhausting Fatigue. There are besides in most
Families those, whom the Feebleness of immature Years, or their Sex, at
particular Periods, or the Decrepitude of old Age, discharge from the Duties
of Tillage. Leather, and Wool, and Cotton, and Flax, are at Hand: How easy

then is the necessary Cloathing provided for those whose Station does not
require any attention or regard to Fashion, or Elegance; so easy, that many
have already gone into this Manufacture without any other Impulse, than
the Spirit of Industry, which can’t bear Inaction, tho’ the Savings on this
Head have afterwards been neglected. In this very considerable Branch so
little Difficulty is there, that a Beginning is Half the Work. The Path is
beaten, there is no Danger of losing the Way, there are Directors to guide
every Step. But why should they stop at the Point of cloathing Labourers,
why not proceed, when Vigour and Strength will increase with the
Progression, to cloath the Planters? When the first Stage is arrived at, the
Spirits will be recruited, and the second should be undertaken with Alacrity,
since it may be performed with Ease. In this too, the Experiment hath been
made and hath succeeded. Let the Manufacture of America be the Symbol
of Dignity, the Badge of Virtue, and it will soon break the Fetters of
Distress. A Garment of Linsey-Wolsey, when made the Distinction of real
Patriotism, is more honourable and attractive of Respect and Veneration,
than all the Pageantry, and the Robes, and the Plumes, and the Diadem of an
Emperor without it. Let the Emulation be not in the Richness and Variety of
foreign Productions, but in the Improvement and Perfection of our own—
Let it be demonstrated that the Subjects of the British Empire in Europe and
America are the same, that the Hardships of the latter will ever recoil upon
the former.13
In Theory it is supposed that each is equally important to the other, that
all partake of the Adversity and Depression of any. The Theory is just, and
Time will certainly establish it, but if another Principle should be ever
hereafter adopted in Practice, and a Violation deliberate, cruel, ungrateful,
and attended with every Circumstance of Provocation, be offered to our
fundamental Rights, why should we leave it to the slow Advances of Time

(which may be the great Hope and Reliance, probably, of the Authors of the
Injury, whose View it may be to accomplish their selfish Purposes in the
Interval) to prove what might be demonstrated immediately—Instead of
moping, and puling, and whining to excite Compassion; in such a Situation
we ought with Spirit, and Vigour, and Alacrity, to bid Defiance to Tyranny,
by exposing it’s Impotence, by making it as contemptible, as it would be
detestable. By a vigorous Application to Manufactures, the Consequence of
Oppression in the Colonies to the Inhabitants of Great-Britain, would strike
Home, and immediately. None would mistake it. Craft and Subtilty would
not be able to impose on the most ignorant and credulous; for if any should
be so weak of Sight as not to See, they would not be so callous as not to
Feel it.—Such Conduct would be the most dutiful and beneficial to the
Mother-Country. It would point out the Distemper when the Remedy might
be easy, and a Cure at once effected by a simple Alteration of Regimen.
Of this Measure should there be Apprehensions, and Ministerial
Orators and Panegyrists endeavour to obviate them by observing, that, “it
would always be easy to reinstate Things where they were, and that by
easing the Colonies of their Burthens, and giving Encouragement to their
Produce; the Establishment of any Manufacture in America might be
prevented.” We should mark well this Reasoning, and avail ourselves of the
Instruction given by our Enemies, which would point out to Us the Remedy,
and the more speedy the Application of it the better, and that would depend
upon ourselves.
Besides the Urgency of such an Occasion (should it happen) there
would be another Powerful Inducement to this simple, natural, easy Method
—The good or bad Success of one Attempt to oppress, generally produces
or prevents future Impositions. In common Life a Tameness in bearing a

Deprivation of Part of a Man’s Property, encourages Rapacity to seize the
rest.
Any Oppression of the Colonies, would intimate an Opinion of them I
am persuaded they don’t deserve, and their Security as well as Honour
ought to engage them to confute. When Contempt is mixed with Injustice,
and Insult with Violence, which is the Case when an Injury is done to him
who hath the Means of Redress in his Power; if the injured hath one
inflammable Grain of Honour in his Breast, his Resentment will invigorate
his Pursuit of Reparation, and animate his Efforts to obtain an effectual
Security against a Repetition of the Outrage.
If the Case supposed should really happen, the Resentment I should
recommend would be a legal, orderly, and prudent Resentment, to be
expressed in a zealous and vigorous Industry,14 in an immediate Use and
unabating Application of the Advantages we derive from our Situation—a
Resentment which could not fail to produce Effects as beneficial to the
Mother-Country as to the Colonies, and which a Regard to her Welfare as
well as our own, ought to inspire us with on such an Occasion.
The General Assemblies would not, I suppose, have it in their Power
to encourage by Laws, the Prosecution of this beneficial, this necessary
Measure; but they might promote it almost as effectually by their Example.
I have in my younger Days seen fine Sights, and been captivated by their
dazzling

Pomp

and glittering

Splendor;

but

the

Sight of our

Representatives, all adorned in compleat Dresses of their own Leather, and
Flax, and Wool, manufactured by the Art and Industry of the Inhabitants of
Virginia, would excite, not the Gaze of Admiration, the Flutter of an
agitated Imagination, or the momentary Amusement of a transient Scene,
but a calm, solid, heartfelt Delight. Such a Sight would give Me more
Pleasure than the most splendid and magnificent Spectacle the most

exquisite Taste ever painted, the richest Fancy ever imagined, realized to
the View—as much more Pleasure as a good Mind would receive from the
Contemplation of Virtue, than of Elegance; of the Spirit of Patriotism, than
the Ostentation of Opulence.
Not only, “as a Friend to the Colonies,” but as an Inhabitant having my
All at Stake upon their Welfare I desire an “Exemption from Taxes imposed
without my Consent, and” I have reflected longer than “a Moment upon the
Consequences:”15 I value it as one of the dearest Privileges I enjoy: I
acknowledge Dependance on Great-Britain, but I can perceive a Degree of
it without Slavery, and I disown all other. I do not expect that the Interests
of the Colonies will be considered by some Men, but in Subserviency to
other Regards. The Effects of Luxury, and Venality, and Oppression,
Posterity may perhaps experience, and SUFFICIENT FOR THE DAY WILL BE THE
EVIL THEREOF.

3It

is asserted in the Pamphlet entitled, The Claim of the Colonies, &c. that
Maryland availing herself of the Protection of Virginia and Pennsylvania,
contributed Nothing to the common Defence. This Writer from a View of
some Map of North-America imagined, it should seem, that Virginia and
Pennsylvania were settled so as to encompass Maryland, but the Truth is,
that the Frontiers of Maryland were as much exposed, as those of the next
Colonies, and the Fact is moreover False, for I have been well informed that
Maryland contributed near 50,000l. and incurred besides a considerable
Expence, which is now a Debt upon the Public Journal of that Colony, by
putting her Militia into actual Service, and that an unhappy Dispute,
attended with a very heavy Provincial Charge on some Topick of Privilege,
was the real Cause, why the Grants of Maryland were not more liberal.
After all, there have been Instances, I speak not of more modern Times, in

which the Parsimony of the Parliament hath been complained of, and the
Notion of Privilege carried to a great Length by the House of Commons;
but these have not been thought solid Reasons for stripping their
Constituents of their Rights.
4It

is asserted by the Author of The Claim of the Colonies, &c. that the
Merchants trading to the several Colonies gave in an Estimate of the Debt
due to Them from the Colonies, amounting to 4,000,000l. It would have
been a real public Service if he had pointed out how this Debt is to be paid
under the Oppression of new and heavy Impositions, or what will be the
proper Remedy if there should be a Stoppage in the Payment of 4,000,000l.
a Stagnation of Commerce, and Want of Employment to the British
Manufacturers.
5It

was formerly held to be a grievous Oppression, that, instead of having
Justice at Home, the English Subject was drawn to Rome by APPEALS, but
an American is to be drawn from Home, in the FIRST INSTANCE, as well as by
Appeals.

8I

have presumed to mention this Fact upon the Authority of private
Intelligence, as well as of the News Papers, and other Publications, and tho’
the Chancellor of the Exchequer is not named, yet the Fact seems in general
to be referred to in the Postscript to the excellent Letter concerning Libels,
Warrants, Seizure of Papers, and Security of the Peace, &c. in the following
Words: “Otherwise (i. e. if it were not right for the Parliament to resolve
general Warrants to be illegal) let me ask how that momentous Resolution
touching an English Parliament’s Right of taxing the Colonies could be
justify’d? It was an independent substantive Resolution, followed by
Nothing, (i. e. that Session) and yet was a Resolution not only of extreme
Magnitude, but of the most general and highest legal Nature, involving in it
a Decision of the first and most fundamental Principles of Liberty, Property,
and Government, and well worthy also, as to the temporary Policy of it, the
most serious of all Consideration. This was resolved too if I am informed

right, at the Close of the Night, and the Rising of the House; so that every
Body must have taken it as a clear Thing, that They could at any Time come
to a Resolution upon any general Point of Law, whenever They should see
it expedient so to do, sed Verbum sapienti sat est.”
9In

the Reign of our great Deliverer, when the English and the Dutch were
at War with France, They joined in preventing the Northern Powers from
carrying on a Trade with the Enemy. M. Groning having formed a Design,
to prove the Right of the Northern Powers to a free Trade and Navigation,
communicated his Plan to and desired the Opinion of Baron Puffendorf
upon it, who observed that as the Question had not been settled upon clear
and undeniable Principles, and there was a Mixture of Fact and Right, the
Confederates might contend that They have a Right to distress the Enemy,
and, as the Means to attain that Purpose, to restrain the Trade of the
Northern Powers, an Argument that with superior Force wou’d be
conclusive.
10A

grave Answer to a little pert Pamphlet, called the Objections to the
Taxation, &c. would be too ludicrous. When the Author of it talks of Orders
to be observed under Pains and Penalties, he uses the aweful Style of a L
——d of T—— but it was too constrained for him to support, and he
therefore very naturally relapsed into the Character of a Jack-Pudding. He
had very little Reason to apprehend that Lock, Sidney, or Selden, would be
called upon to pull off his—Cap.

the Narrative of the Outrages committed by the Soldiery, on Mr.
Justice Walker in Canada.
12A

late notable Speech puts me in Mind of the Ingenuity of the Female
Disputant, who used to silence Debate, by crying out, God bless the King
and what have you to say to that?
13Upon

a Surmise that a certain noble L—d, was the Author of some
Hardships inflicted upon the Colonies, a reproachful and mischievous
Distinction hath been made by some People, between the Natives of S—t—
d, and of E—g—d and America, which every judicious Friend of the
Colonies must wish to see abolish’d, and an Union rather established than

Divisions promoted. Every Man who has his all, and the Welfare of his
Posterity at Stake, upon the Prosperity of America, as he hath an Interest in
common with the Natives of it, ought to be considered as an American—It
is an effectual Way to make Men Adversaries, to call and treat Them as
such—Besides, laying aside this Consideration, the Distinction is extremely
unjust; for tho’ there is too much Reason to believe that some Natives of
America, and of E—g—d, who have resided in the Colonies, have been
instrumental in bringing upon Us the Severities We deplore, yet hath it
never been even surmised, I speak it to their Honour, that any Native of S—t
—d residing, or that ever did reside in America, had in any Degree a Hand
in them. It is much to be feared, if the Breach which a too eager Prosecution
of the little Views of Party, hath made among the Inhabitants of a Colony
heretofore the most distinguished for Prudence and Unanimity, should not
be closed, in Consideration of the general Calamity, that America as well as
Denmark, will furnish an Instance of the excessive Temerity of political
Animosity.
14The

ingenious Mr. Hume, observes in his History of James I, that the
English fine Cloth was in so little Credit even at Home, that the King was
obliged to seek Expedients by which he might engage the People of Fashion
to wear it, and the Manufacture of fine Linen was totally unknown in the
Kingdom—What an Encouragement to Industry! This very penetrating
Gentleman also recommends a mild Government, as a proper Measure for
preserving the Dominion of England over her Colonies.

APPENDIX.

B

Y

the 12th Cha. II, the Colonies are restrain’d from sending the

Products enumerated in the Act to any foreign Ports.—By the 15th of

the same King, they are prohibited from importing Commodities of the
Growth or Manufacture of Europe, except from GREAT-BRITAIN, saving a
few Articles mention’d in this Act.
A Law, which restrains one Part of the Society, from exporting it’s
Products to the most profitable Market, in favour of another; or obliges it to
import the Manufactures of one Country that are dear, instead of those of
another that are cheap, is effectually a Tax. For if the profitable
Exportation, and the Importation of the cheaper Commodities were
permitted, a Tax equal to such Gain in the former Case, and to the Saving in
the latter, wou’d leave that Part of the Society, in the same State and
Condition, as if under the Prohibition and Restriction above-mentioned. As
for Instance in the Case of Importation—Suppose a Country which I will
distinguish by the Name of A, can purchase Commodities of the same Kind,
and equal Goodness, 20 per Cent cheaper of B, than she can of C;—then it
is clear, if A is prohibited from taking these Commodities of B, and obliged
to purchase them of C, that A is just in the same State and Condition, as if
she were allow’d to purchase the Commodities of B, on paying thereon a
Duty of 20 per Cent to C.—This Instance, mutatis mutandis, is equally
applicable to the Case of Exportation. Hence it appears, that the Country
favour’d by the Prohibition and Restriction, gains as much thereby, as it
wou’d do, if the proportionate Tax were paid to it, upon taking off the
Prohibition and Restriction; or, in other Words, the Profit which the one is

hinder’d from making, in Consequence of the Prohibition and Restriction, is
made by the other, in whose favour they have been introduc’d.
It hath been observed by a well-received Writer on the Subject of
Trade, that “a Prohibition acknowledges the Commodities it is laid on, to be
good and cheap, otherwise it were needless, and a Prohibition on the Goods
of any one Nation, gives a Monopoly to other Nations, that raise the
like.”—Again—“A Prohibition against any one Nation, makes other
Nations, having the like Commodities, take the Advantage and raise their
Price, and is therefore a Tax.”16
If a Prohibition, extending to one Nation only in favour of many,
confers a Monopoly, and is therefore a Tax; a Prohibition extending to all
other Nations in favour of one, is indubitably so.
From Virginia and Maryland are exported, communibus Annis, 90,000
Hogsheads of Tobacco to Great-Britain, of which it is suppos’d 60,000 are
thence re-exported. But these Colonies not being permitted to send their
Tobacco immediately to foreign Markets distributively, in proportion to
their Demands, the re-exported Tobacco pays double Freight, double
Insurance, Commission and other Shipping Charges. The whole Quantity is,
moreover, of Course much depreciated, for going all to Great-Britain, the
Home-Market is overdone, by which Circumstance, the Quantity requir’d
for Home-Consumption is without Doubt purchased cheaper than it wou’d
be, if no more than that were imported into Great-Britain, and of this Glut
Foreigners, and Purchasers on Speculation also, avail themselves. Besides,
a great deal of the Tobacco getting home late, the rigorous Season hinders
it’s being re-shipp’d for some Months, during which, it is dead on hand, and
moreover gives Advantage to Buyers—a Loss to the Planter, which wou’d
be avoided, if the Tobacco cou’d be immediately sent to it’s proper Market.
—

The above quoted Author hath computed the Duties, Excises, &c. on
Leather, at 50 per Cent; and the Artificial Value of a Bale of English Cloth
arising from Taxes, Monopolies and ill-judg’d Laws at 51 per Cent, by
which, he means that every Hundred Pounds Worth of that Species of
Manufacture, includes in that Sum 51l. of Taxes. His Computation is,
without Doubt, too low now, Taxes having been increased very
considerably since the Time, in which he wrote.

But lest the Estimate shou’d be objected to on account of it’s including
20 per Cent for Monopolies, &c. I will state the artificial Value arising from
Taxes, only to be 33l. 6s. 8d. which will hardly be objected to, for being too
high.

Part of the Commodities sent from Great-Britain to the Colonies, is
first imported into Great-Britain from foreign Countries; but the Estimate is
not exceptionable on that Account, for the general Calculation on the
advanced Price of British Manufactures, is extremely low.—Several of the
foreign Commodities receive their Perfection in Britain.—All of them are
enhanced by the Articles of double Freight, Insurance, Shipping Charges,
the Merchant Importer’s Commission, the English Tradesman a Profit, the
Merchant Exporter’s Commission, and Subsidies retain’d. If the Colonies
were not restrain’d from directly importing foreign Commodities, they
would, it is presum’d, pay less for them, even by 50 per Cent, than they do
at present.

It hath been already observ’d, that there are shipped from Virginia and
Maryland, annually, at an Average, about 90,000 Hogsheads of Tobacco,
60,000 of which, or upwards, are re-exported from Great-Britain, to foreign
Markets; but they pay to Great-Britain, for the Reasons above explain’d, 3l.
per Hogshead, i. e. the Sum of 3l. upon each Hogshead might be saved if
the Tobacco might be immediately and distributively sent to the respective
Markets, in Proportion to their Demands; and an equal Sum is paid also to
Great-Britain, upon the same Rule of Computation, i. e. that these Colonies
pay what they might save, if not restrain’d. For, tho’ the English
Manufacturer gets the Tobacco he wants, without the double Freight, &c.
yet he has the Advantage of the Glut, and an Opportunity of buying it as
cheap, as it is sold in Great-Britain for the foreign Markets, before the
Charges of double Freight, &c. are incurred, and therefore the Planter gets
no more for his Tobacco sold for Home, than that which is sold for Foreign
Consumption, and consequently pays as much for it. For there is great
Reason to imagine, that if these Colonies were at Liberty to send their
Tobacco immediately where they pleas’d, the Market in England wou’d be
as profitable as those of France, Holland, &c.—But when the Tobacco,
under the present Regulation, is purchased for Re-Exportation, the
Purchaser undoubtedly considers the Expence he is to be at, before it gets to
the foreign Market, as Part of the Price of the Commodity, and therefore
lowers his Price to the Merchant in Proportion.

It appears then, that the whole Tax is upwards of 65 per Cent; and if,
therefore, the artificial Value of One Hundred Pounds Worth of British
Manufacture, (Cloth for Instance) is, according to the above Computation,
33l. 6s. 8d. there was, before the Stamp-Act, a Tax paid by the NorthAmericans, near double of that which is paid by the Inhabitants of England.
If the above Sum of 33l. 6s. 8d. is too low, and ought to be increased, then
the Tax on North-America, on the Article of Manufactures imported from
Britain, must also be increased.
It shou’d seem that the Maxim of every Tax upon Labour falling
ultimately upon the Consumer of its Product, cannot be strictly applied to
the Product of the North-American Colonies. For, as they are obliged to

send their Commodities to some Port in the British Dominions, or (where
Indulgence is granted to send some of them to other Places) deprived in
great Measure of the Benefit of Returns, they are by this Means subjected to
dead Freight; and moreover, being confin’d in their Consumption to a
particular Manufacture, and the Commodities they export, being chiefly raw
Materials, they have not the Means generally in the Power of other People,
by raising the Price of their Labour, to throw their Burthens upon others;
but are, for the most Part, obliged, both in their Exports and Imports, to
submit to an arbitrary Determination of their Value, though even below first
Cost.
The sanguine Genius of one of the Anti-American Writers, brings to
my Mind the Fable of the Boy and the Hen that laid Golden Eggs. He is not
content to wait for the Increase of the Public Revenue, by that gradual
Process and Circulation of Property, which an Attention to the commercial
Interests of the Nation hath establish’d, but is at once for tearing away the
Embryo, which, in due Time, might be matur’d into Fullness of Size and
Vigour; without ever reflecting, that when the Hen is destroy’d by his
Violence, there will be no more GOLDEN EGGS.—The following Passage
justifies this Observation—
“If we have from the Colonies their ALL already, we only have it (says
he) by Trade, and not by Taxes; and surely it is not the same Thing, whether
the Wealth be brought into the Public Coffers by Taxes, or coming in by
Trade, flows into the Pockets of Individuals, and, by augmenting his
Influence with his Wealth, enables the Merchant to plunge us into new Wars
and new Debts for his Advantage.”17
The Man who thinks the Gains of the Merchant are dangerous, and that
the Welfare of the Manufacturers, the Landholders, &c. doth not depend
upon the Trade and Navigation of Great-Britain, is very consistently an

Advocate for a Measure which hath a direct Tendency to check them; but
whether this Opinion, and very consistent Conduct, might not be more
serviceable in some other Employment, than in that of a L—— of T——, is
submitted to their Consideration, who are the Judges of Merit, and the
Dispensers of its Rewards.
For a Reason, which the above Opinion suggests, I shall subjoin an
Estimate of the Duties upon Tobacco consumed in Great-Britain, and of the
Profit to the Planter on that Tobacco.—The intelligent Reader will not
apprehend it to be my Meaning, that the Planter pays out of his Pocket all
the Duties laid on Tobacco, or be at a Loss to infer, that the Estimate has
been made with no other View, than to obviate the Principle others by their
Writings seem to adopt.

The full clear Proceeds of an Hogshead of Tobacco, reckoning 952lb–
in each Hogshead, has not, on an Average for some Years past, exceeded
4l.18 wherefore, on 30,000 Hogsheads, the Planters get 120,000l. How
much of the above Sum of 831,000l. is nett to the Revenue, I shall not
undertake to say; but I presume it may be safely asserted, that no Part of
this, or any other Public Money, is touch’d by any Americans, whether they
have great Powers of Speech or not; tho’ any Gentleman who might be

affected by it, is not to be blamed for his Apprehension, that a sudden
Importation of a certain Commodity, might hurt the home Market.
The Sum of the Taxes, paid in North-America, will appear enormous to
those, who, having been told that these Colonies pay only 7 or 800l. per
Annum, in Consequence of Taxes laid there, might be led, in their
Dependence upon Ministerial Candor, to believe, that they paid no more
elsewhere;—but to others, who are better acquainted with the Subject, the
Computation will appear too low.—From these Observations it may be
infer’d what vast Wealth, in Taxes only, the Mother-Country has, in the
Course of a Hundred Years, drawn from her Colonies; and how profoundly
well-inform’d the Writer is, who, with equal Pertinency and Confidence,
pronounces, “that it is now high Time for England to draw some little Profit
from her Colonies, after the vast Treasure she has expended on their
Settlement.”
I confess that the above Computations are conjectural, but I believe
they are probable. I mean that those, who are best acquainted with the
Subject, will think the Charge upon North-America is not exaggerated, and
which I think very naturally accounts for the enormous Debt she at present
labours under to the Mother-Country.
Dr. Davenant observes, that, “if ever any Thing great or good be done
for the English Colonies, Industry must have its due Recompence, and that
can’t be without Encouragement to it, which, perhaps is only to be brought
about by confirming their Liberties, and establishing good Discipline
among them;—that, as they see they are a Free People, in Point of
Government, so they may, by Discipline, be kept free of the Mischiefs that
follow Vice and Idleness. And, as great Care should be taken in this
Respect, so without Doubt, it is adviseable, that no little Emulation of
private Interests of Neighbour Governors, nor that the Petitions of hungry

Courtiers at home, shou’d prevail to discourage those particular Colonies,
who, in a few Years, have raised themselves by their own Charge, Prudence
and Industry, to the Wealth and Greatness they are now arriv’d at, without
any Expence to the Crown; upon which Account, any Innovations, or
Breach of their original Charters, (besides that it seems a Breach of the
Public Faith) may, peradventure, not tend to the King’s Profit.” Excellent
Observation! but how little it hath been regarded, the present deeplyafflicting Distress of the Inhabitants of North-America demonstrates;—a
Distress sufficient to drive Men into Despair, who are not animated by the
Hope, that—DEUS DABIT HIS QUOQUE FINEM.
THE END.

before, P. 301. The attentive Reader will observe, that the nett
Proceeds of a Hogshead of Tobacco, at an Average, are 4l. and the Taxes 3l.
—, together, 7l.—Quere, How much per Cent does the Tax amount to,
which takes from the two wretched Tobacco Colonies, 3l. out of every 7l.?
And how deplorable must their Circumstances appear, when their vast Debt
to the Mother-Country, and the annual Burthen of their civil Establishments
are added to the Estimate? In these two Colonies there are upwards of
180,000 Taxables.
