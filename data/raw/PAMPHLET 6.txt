PAMPHLET 6
[Thomas Whately], The Regulations Lately Made Concerning
the Colonies, and the Taxes Imposed upon Them, Considered.
London, 1765.
The Stamp Act, which was approved in the House of Commons on February 27, 1765, and given
royal assent on March 22, imposed a tax on legal documents, bonds, deeds, almanacs, newspapers,
college diplomas, playing cards, indeed, on nearly every form of paper used in the colonies.
Although some of the colonial assemblies had issued stamp taxes, never before had Parliament
attempted to impose this kind of internal tax on the colonists. Once the ministry sensed a stirring of
colonial opposition to the imperial reforms, a group of able English writers connected with the
government set out to explain and justify the new regulations and taxes in a series of pamphlets. The
most important and persuasive of these defenses of British policy was the following pamphlet, which
was attributed to George Grenville, the prime minister from 1763 to 1765, but which was actually
written by Thomas Whately, undersecretary to Grenville at the treasury and the principal drafter of
the Stamp Act.
Before offering a justification of his measure, though, Whately devoted much of his lengthy
pamphlet to his vision of a well-regulated and prosperous empire. Throughout he demonstrated an
extraordinarily detailed knowledge of all aspects of the various colonies, including the value of
numerous colonial commodities—from beaver skins to whale fins, rice to hemp. The administration
of this “opulent, commercial, thriving” empire required money, and against this backdrop the need
for American revenue emerged as the focus of his pamphlet.
Whately conceded that no British subject could be taxed without the consent of his representatives;
but since he believed that the colonists were intimately connected to the people of the mother
country, being both parts of “one Nation,” he readily justified Parliament’s extraction of the needed
revenue by what the British called “virtual representation.” Although the colonists, like many
Englishmen in the mother country, did not actually vote for members of Parliament, they were
nonetheless virtually represented there, and consequently bound by its laws. The people were
represented not by the electoral process, that is, by voting, which was incidental to representation, but
instead by the mutual interests that members of Parliament were presumed to share with all Britons
for whom they spoke—including those, like the colonists, who did not actually vote for them. How

the representatives got to the House of Commons was irrelevant to their ability to represent the
interests of the nation.
Absurd as this concept of virtual representation seemed to many Americans, it justified the binding
of the whole people, in Whately’s words, “by the Consent of the Majority of that House, whether
their own particular Representatives consented to or opposed the Measures there taken, or whether
they had or had not particular Representatives there.” It was probably the best justification of
majority rule ever made.

The Regulations Lately made with Respect to the
Colonies Considered.

immediate Defence of our Colonies from imminent Danger, was

the sole occasion of the last War: Their permanent Security has been

effectually obtained by the Peace: And even their Aggrandizement and
Improvement have been provided for by the Negotiators of that Treaty,
beyond the idea of any former Administration: There have been Ministers
ignorant of the Importance of the Colonies; others, have impotently
neglected their Concerns; and others again have been diverted by meaner
Pursuits from attending to them: But happily for this Country, the Real and
Substantial, and those are the Commercial Interests of Great Britain, are
now preferred to every other Consideration: And the Trade from whence its
greatest Wealth is derived, and upon which its Maritime Power is
principally founded, depends upon a wise and proper use of the Colonies:
From them we are to expect the Multiplication of Subjects; the
Consumption of our Manufactures; the Supply of those Commodities which
we want; and the encrease of our Navigation: To encourage their Population
and their Culture; to regulate their Commerce; and to cement and perfect
the necessary Connection between them and the Mother-Country, should
therefore be the principal Objects of a British Minister’s care; and many
Steps have been lately taken, which by their immediate Operation, or
distant Consequences, may materially affect these important Concerns.
Every Man who is sincerely interested in whatever is interesting to his
Country, will anxiously consider the Propriety of these Measures; will
enquire into the Information, and Canvass the Principles upon which they

have been adopted; and will be ready to applaud what has been well done;
to condemn what has been done amiss; and to suggest any Emendations,
Improvements, or Additions, which may lie within his Knowledge, and
occur to his Reflection. The following Sheets are written with a View to
facilitate such an Examination: They pretend to no more than to collect the
several Regulations that have been lately made with respect to the Colonies:
To weigh the Reasons upon which each of them appears to have been
founded; and to see how far these are supported by Facts, and by Maxims of
Trade and of Policy. These Regulations are many; and have been made in
the different Departments of our Legislative or Executive Government:
They are therefore scattered thro’ Proclamations, Statutes, and Orders: But
they are all of equal Publick Notoriety; which every Man may know; which
every Man ought to know; and which when brought into one View and
considered together, will appear to be either crude, incoherent, weak and
pernicious Acts of Power, or a well digested consistent, wise and salutary
Plan of Colonization and Government.
The new Acquisitions will naturally first attract our Attention: They
are vast in extent, and richly productive of the valuable Commodities which
belong to their several Climates; but besides these, we derive further
Advantages from them on Account of their Situations: The Possession of
those in North America ensures the safety of the other Colonies there;
insomuch, that our only dangerous Neighbours, the French, do not think the
Pittance that was left them on the Continent, worth Retaining, but by the
Cession they are said to have made of Louisiana to the Spaniards, have
avowedly given up for ever those great Objects, for which alone they began
the War. The ceded Islands are of almost equal Consequence, for Protecting
our own, and for Annoying the Settlements of the French and Spaniards, if
they should be again our Enemies. But the greater the Importance of these

Accessions to the British Dominion, so much the more Care and
Circumspection is requisite in the Dispositions to be made concerning
them: And such is the Difference of their Situations and Circumstances, that
the same Regulations may be necessary to the one, and fatal to the other.
The Benefit which accrues to the Mother-Country from a Colony on
the Continent, principally depends on the Number of its Inhabitants; that of
a Plantation in the Islands arises from the Richness of its Commodities: We
rely on the former chiefly for the Consumption of our Manufactures: We
expect more from the Produce of the latter, for our own Consumption and
for Exportation: This Distinction is so strictly true, that tho’ the Supply
required by the Inhabitants of the West-Indies is in value much beyond that
which is necessary to the Americans in Proportion to their Numbers, yet,
that Wealth, that Luxury, and those Circumstances of Climate, which
incline them to Extravagance, at the same Time induce them to prefer the
finer Productions of other Countries, to the coarse Commodities of our
own; for the Manufactures of Great Britain are good, rich, and solid, but
not delicate; strong without Grace; and rather substantial than elegant: To
the plain, the industrious and frugal Republican of America, who is content
with the Necessaries of Life, these are welcome, because they are useful:
but they are not equally acceptable to the West-Indians, who think
themselves intitled to Superfluities, and whose aristocratical Opulence
enables them to demand the Products of the East-Indies, and other
Countries, more similar in Climate, in Taste, and in Manners, to their own.
We are therefore for the most part only Merchants to the one, and sell to
them what we ourselves purchase; but we are both Merchants and
Manufacturers to the other. The Returns too from each of these Countries,
are as different as their Demands: The Products of the Continent are the
Earnings of Industry; those of the Islands are the Improvements of Wealth:

To an American therefore a numerous Family is Substance; but a West
Indian must depend entirely upon his Capital: He cannot labour himself; he
can acquire nothing but by Purchase and Expence. From this Difference of
Circumstances it is evident, that the Object of Government with respect to
the Acquisitions in North America, should be to tempt Inhabitants thither,
and to encourage Population; and with respect to the ceded Islands, to
enforce the speedy Culture and Improvement of Spots productive of such
valuable Commodities, but still requiring a considerable Expence to raise
and manage those Commodities. Lands therefore should be granted on easy
Terms of Settlement in the one; but sold under strict Conditions of
Cultivation in the other.
Agreeably to these Principles, the Governors of Quebec, East Florida
and West Florida, (we are told by his Majesty’s Proclamation of the 7th of
October,) are authorized, To grant Lands upon such Terms, and under such
moderate Quit-Rents, Services, and Acknowledgements, as have been
appointed and settled in the other Colonies, and under such other
Conditions as shall appear necessary and expedient for the advantage of
the Grantees, and the Improvement and Settlement of the said Colonies.
The Experience of a Century has suggested this Mode of Settlement; under
the same or similar Terms to these, the whole Continent of America has
been peopled, and near two Million of Subjects now hold by the Tenure
proposed in this Proclamation. No further Encouragment is necessary; for
Grants in the New, will always be prefered to the like Grants in the old
Colonies: Novelty and Uncertainty attracts Adventurers, who besides ideal
Allurements, may depend upon real Advantages; they have their Choice to
a great Degree of the Lands they will take up, and the first that are taken up
will probably in a few Years become valuable Estates; with these and many
other Circumstances of Recommendation, there can be no doubt that the

new Colonies, when put upon the same Footing with the other, will be
peopled very soon. Many foreign Protestants will go thither. I fear they will
be too much resorted to from these Kingdoms, and from Ireland, unless
Employment can be found at home for those who must else seek it at a
distance; but the greatest Supply will be from America itself; for such has
been the Population of that Country, that many Parts of it can afford to
furnish Inhabitants to others. The enterprizing Spirit and Passion for
Discovery, which led its first Settlers thither, is not extinct in their Posterity,
who are still inclined to rove in quest of new Habitations: They are all bred
to the Idea of clearing fresh Lands, and of acquiring to themselves such
Estates as their Fathers acquired, by those Means which they have seen so
successful in their own Families. In the Provinces which are not yet well
settled, this Principle operates within the Provinces themselves; but there
are some, in which the greater Part of the Lands near the Sea Coasts and
Banks of Rivers, are already occupied; and there the same Principle impels
the younger Inhabitants to Migration. If the Colony should at first regret
their Departure, the Loss will quickly be repaired by those who are left, and
who in a few Years will be able to fill up the Intervals still remaining
between the several Settlements; and with respect to the Mother Country, it
is certainly very desirable that her People should be spread along every
Coast and every River within her Dominions; for the Means of Subsistance
will be easier there, than in the interior Parts of the old Colonies: The
Settlers will consequently multiply faster, and their Consumption of our
Manufactures will in the End be greater; they must apply to Agriculture
alone; their Plantations will be open to immediate Access, as well for
receiving our Supply, as for returning to us their Produce; and neither the
old nor the new Colony, so long as they have Lands given them to cultivate,
will have Hands, nor be at leisure to turn to Manufactures: the Connection

of both with the Mother-Country is thereby strengthened, and thus our new
Acquisitions instead of making the British Empire too great and unwieldly;
on the contrary, enhance the Value, and secure the Dependance of our
former Possessions.
That the granting of Lands in the new Acquisitions upon the same
Terms as they are granted in the other Colonies, will alone produce the
Effect I have described, is not Matter of Speculation only, but is founded
upon constant Experience, brought down to the present Time by very recent
Instances. That Part of Nova Scotia, which was held by the neutral French,
has since their Removal been resorted to with an Eagerness hardly
conceivable: I am greatly within Compass when I say that it contains
already above Ten Thousand Inhabitants, all settled within the Compass of
Six or Seven Years; by whose Industry that Province, which so lately was
considered as no more than a proper Situation for a Fortress, whose
Garrison it could not subsist, will instead of being a desolate Frontier, soon
become a flourishing Colony, thronged with a hardy Race of People, who
by clearing away the Wood will soften the Rigour of the Climate, and find
themselves richly overpaid in the inexhaustible Fertility of the Soil.
It is not Rashness to foretell a similar Progress, in the settlement of our
other Acquisitions: Even Cape Breton, that barren Appendage to the same
Province of Nova Scotia, is known now to contain Treasures, which the
Ministry have thought so worthy of Attention, as to insert in every Grant a
particular Covenant with respect to them. All Coal-Mines are, I understand
to be reserved to the Crown; if they were not, the Settlers would be diverted
from the Cultivation of Lands, to be Mine Adventurers, led into Enterprizes
they would not be able to support, by the tempting promises with which
Uncertainty flatters and seduces: On the other hand, these Collieries when
reserved to the Crown, may be managed by its Officers, or let to such as are

able to make a proper Improvement of them. And there is hardly a doubt of
Success in the Undertaking, if it be supported by the Expence it will
require: For in many parts of America, especially in the Neighbourhood of
the Great Towns, a Supply of Fuel is wanting: Such has been the Force and
Extent of Cultivation, that Wood is become scarce in Countries, which were
an impenetrable Forest not a Century ago; and the General Assemblies have
therefore found it necessary to make Provisions for the Preservation of
Timber. Coal from Cape Breton may on this Account be delivered in many
of the Great Towns of America, at a cheaper Rate than any other Firing can
be bought; and be the Demand ever so great, the Supply from thence will
always be equal to it: For the Mines are not Veins; they are Mountains of
Coal: Vast Clifts of nothing else stand open and accessible: No Boring is
necessary to find it; no Pit need be sunk to come at it; no Fire Engines will
be requisite for carrying on the Works: Adequate Capitals only must be had
for making the Leading Ways; for providing a sufficient Stock of Carriages,
and of Draught Horses or Oxen; and for keeping a large Quantity of Coal
always ready to answer the Demands that may be made. These Collieries
therefore which do not seem the Objects of Grant, because in the hands of
common Settlers they would either be neglected, or prove ruinous to many
of the Adventurers, may under proper Management, be at the same time
very advantageous and convenient to the most settled Parts of North
America, a considerable Nursery of Seamen, and a means of subsisting
useful Inhabitants in a Climate too inhospitable for much Cultivation.
This Island however, and all the Neighbouring Shores in the Gulph of
St. Laurence, have another Fund of Wealth in their Fisheries, which will
attract Inhabitants without Number, and furnish the Means of Subsistance to
all. A Resident Fishery will always overpower one that is carried on from a
Distance: The People concerned in it can begin to Fish as soon as the

Season permits, and will therefore be the first at Market; and the Merchants
who send Ships thither from Great Britain, may freight their Vessels
outwards, and be sure of a vent for their Cargoes, in the Colonies near to the
Fisheries. By this Advantage they will be enabled to dispose of the Return
at a cheaper Rate than the French, who have no such Colonies to take off
their outward-bound Cargo: For the Profit of the British will be equal to that
of the French Merchant upon the whole Voyage, tho’ it should be less upon
the Fish; the absolute Exclusion therefore of any French Settlement from
that part of the World, (for I cannot call Miquelon and St. Pierre
Settlements) will make such a difference between the Fisheries of the two
Rival Nations, that Great Britain must, with respect to supplying other
Countries, enjoy almost a Monopoly: And the necessary Consequence will
be the Population of all those Coasts, where a Trade so beneficial and
encreasing is established. Add to the Cod Fishery that of Whales, which
under the Encouragement given to it during the last Sessions of Parliament,
will immediately become a considerable Branch of Commerce (as I shall
have occasion to shew more at large hereafter;) and there can be no doubt
that in a few Years all these Coasts will be flourishing Colonies: The
Prospect of their future Prosperity has, we have already seen, raised a
Competition for Grants of Lands there: And the general Expectation which
this Competition proves, will hasten the Event it presages. Care however
must be taken to remove all Obstructions which may arise from Regulations
that were established at a time, when these Countries were not in
Contemplation: One of these was the Duty upon Whale-fins, which is now
taken off by Act of Parliament; another arises from the Act of 15 Car. 2. c.
7. s. 6. which wisely prohibits the Importation of any European
Commodities into the Plantations, unless they have been laden and shipped
in Britain: But in that Act itself is an Exception of Salt, for the Fisheries of

New England and Newfoundland, upon which the Expence and Delay of
bringing the Salt they consume thro’ this Country, would have been a heavy
Burthen. The Indulgence of carrying it directly from Europe has been since
extended to New York and Pensylvania, by 13 Geo. 1. c. 5, and by 3 Geo. 2.
c. 12, and among the Reasons for granting it, which are recited in the
Preambles to both those Acts, the Encouragement thereby given to the
Fisheries of those Colonies, will, it is said, be highly beneficial both to the
Inhabitants of the said Colonies, and to the Trade of Great Britain, and
enable the said Inhabitants to purchase more of the British Manufactures
for their Use, than they are at present able to do. The same Reasoning
surely applies with greater force to our unsettled new Acquisitions; and
therefore the Legislature have had the precaution by an Act of the last
Sessions, to provide that Canada and the Additions to Newfoundland and
Nova Scotia should be comprehended within the Indulgence allowed to
those, who are in the like Circumstances with respect to the Fisheries.
As the Benefits arising from the increase of the Fisheries will spread
themselves one way along all the Coasts of our former Colonies, they will
in like Manner extend into the new Government of Quebec, whose
Inhabitants will of course be deeply concerned in so beneficial a Trade,
carried on just in their Neighbourhood: The Peltry will be another great
Branch of their Commerce; and the Countenance given to one of its most
valuable Articles during the last Winter, by taking off the Duty upon Beaver
imported here, will be a Means of its increase. I shall reserve for another
Place a more particular Account of the Regulation which relates to that
Commodity, and only mention it occasionally here, as one Circumstance
among many, which will tend to the Improvement of Quebec; but there is
no Ground for any Anxiety about the Population of this Province: It is
already a flourishing Colony, and raises within itself all Kinds of Provisions

in great Plenty: It is said that the Inhabitants now amount to ninety
Thousand: They will certainly within a short Space of Time be more
numerous than they are; and their Demand upon Great Britain for a Supply
of Manufactures must be immediately very considerable.
It would be Presumption to speak with equal Confidence of the
Southern as of the Northern Acquisitions in America; they were never
frequented by the English; we have not that Acquaintance with them, which
Conquest has given us with the others, and even their former Possessors
were from want of Ability or Inclination, uninformed of their real Value.
All Accounts however agree in representing West Florida as surprizingly
fertile: In its natural State clearer of Wood than any other Part of the
Continent, and luxuriantly productive of every Thing else; yielding
spontaneously great Variety of Vegetables, abounding with Game and with
Cattle, and not only promising, but actually producing Wines, Silk, and
Indigo.
With respect to East Florida, it has been so much the Subject of
Conversation, Ridicule, and Dispute, that it is difficult to form any very
certain Ideas concerning it; yet that it is not known to those who depreciate
it, is clear, from their Account of it: The Country they say can never be a
flourishing Colony, for it is barren, and the greater Part of it is occupied by
Tribes of Indians, more numerous and more fierce than any other in
America: The two Circumstances are absolutely inconsistent; for where the
Indians are numerous, the Country must be fruitful: They who do not
cultivate Land, require much for their Subsistance; and if the natural
Productions of the Soil are sufficient for such a Consumption, a populous
Settlement may depend upon procuring Plenty by Culture. But I believe the
Fact to be, that the Eastern Coasts, which alone were formerly visited, are
sandy and barren: More recent Accounts however represent the interior

Parts of the Country, as quite the Reverse; and at the same Time the
Indians, who possess it, and who were once numerous, are said to be
greatly reduced in their Numbers: The Mulberry and Orange Trees, the
Vine, and the Indigo, and Cotton Plants, grow wild in many Parts of the
Provinces: These it has in common with Georgia and South Carolina; but it
has one Advantage over them, that being situated between two Seas, and
out of the Reach of the bleak Winds, which blow from the Apalachian
Mountains, it is not subject to that Excess of Cold in Winter, or to those
sudden Changes of Weather at all Times of the Year, which, by the frequent
Disappointments they occasion, have hitherto retarded the Progress that
might have been expected, in the Culture and Management of the tender
Plants abovementioned.
Both the Floridas are in Climate better adapted to such Cultivation
than any other Colony upon the Continent; and I am confident, will be
found equal in Soil to the best; to all which must be added, that as the
building a Town is one of the first, but at the same Time the most difficult,
because the most expensive Step to be taken in a new Settlement, this
principal Object is already secured in East Florida, which the Spaniards
have entirely deserted; and thereby have left St. Augustine, in which were
three Thousand White Inhabitants, ready for the Reception and
Accommodation of the English.
Mobile in West-Florida, tho’ not so considerable a Place, is still large
enough to obviate the Difficulties, arising from the Want of any Town at all
in an Infant Colony; and both will soon increase considerably, by the Resort
of those who engage in the contraband Trade with the Spanish Settlements,
for which these Places are most conveniently situated. Numbers will never
be wanting to settle Countries, where immediate Subsistance is from the
Fertility of the Soil so certain; and the Prospect of future Wealth is from

their valuable Productions, and their lucrative Trade so very flattering; and
indeed I have heard some Persons esteem the Lands there so highly, as to
think they ought to have been sold: But the Experiment would have been
dangerous in Countries so little known, whose staple Commodities cannot
be yet ascertained, and where Population is at present the principal Object:
Perhaps hereafter it may be a point deserving Consideration, whether the
publick should not avail itself of the Value of the Lands it has to dispose of:
At present it seems quite sufficient to make this Advantage of those Lands
only, which are to be exposed to Sale in the West-Indies: for their Products
and their Culture are certain; and they will find Purchasers, which the others
probably might not to any sufficient Number.
But I am very glad to see that the future Opulence of the two Floridas
is so far already in Prospect, as to prevent the Administration from being
seduced by the Circumstances of Contiguity, and Resemblance, to unite
them under one Government. The Expence of two different Establishments
is not to be put in Competition with the Security that results from dividing a
Power, which might hereafter become alarming: We have not a better
Pledge for the Dependance of the Colonies upon the Mother Country, than
that which arises from their being so many distinct Provinces: Unconnected
with each other but by their Relation to Great-Britain, different in their
Manners, opposites in their Principles, and frequently clashing in their
Interests and their Views, from Rivalry in Trade and the Jealousy of
Neighbourhood, they can never form an Alliance that will be dangerous to
the Mother Country; and no one of them is separately formidable: This
happy Division was the effect of Accident, but it should be continued
throughout by Design: And without promoting Discord or Variance between
them, only by taking care that too great a proportion of Territory, People,
and Wealth, be not united under one Head, and actuated by the same

Motives, the Connection common to all with the Mother Country will be
preserved entire, every other Bond of Union will be excluded, and the vast
System of Great Britain and its Colonies will be permanent and compleat.
Among the Settlers in the new Acquisitions will be many Officers and
Soldiers, to whom Lands are offered by his Majesty’s Proclamation, in
reward for their Services; and who will defend and improve the Countries,
which were won by their Valour. But this Bounty is very properly restrained
with great Strictness to those who served there during the late War, who are
now reduced or disbanded, and actually residing there, and who shall
personally apply to the Governors for the Lands which under those
Circumstances they may claim in the several Proportions assigned them by
the Proclamation. Were it extended to all Officers and Soldiers, many might
be tempted to leave this Country, which is at all times too thinly peopled,
and at present is exhausted by the War: But confined to such as served in
America, and still continue there, the only Effect of it is to make their
Residence comfortable in a Country, where without it they would probably
remain.
The

Encouragement

given

to

Settlement,

is

not

however

indiscriminately extended to the whole Continent of North-America, tho’
we have now got the Command of the whole. On the contrary, Limits are
mark’d beyond which the British Colonies are not for the present allow’d to
encroach upon the Territories of the Indians. The Governors of Quebec,
East Florida, and West Florida are therefore strictly forbidden by the
Proclamation, to pass any Patents for Lands beyond the Bounds of their
respective Governments, and all the Governors of the other Colonies are in
like Manner prohibited from making such Grants of any Lands, beyond the
Heads or Sources of any of the Rivers which fall into the Atlantic Ocean,
from the West and North West, or of any Lands whatsoever, which not

having been ceded by or purchased of the Indians, are reserved to them as
their hunting Grounds. By this prudent Restriction not only one Occasion of
Wars equally impolitic and unjust with the Indians, is prevented; but our
own Colonists are directed to Settlements of more Importance; nearer to the
Sea; and nearer to the Places already well settled: where their Means of
Subsistance will be more easy and certain; their Communication with the
Mother Country more frequent; and their Dependance upon it more secure;
and where they will neither provoke the Indians by their Encroachments,
nor tempt them by their exposed and defenceless Situation, to attack them.
But another Title to Lands might be set up; That of Purchase from the
Indians; which being a Transaction of private Persons only, would be liable
to more Abuses, and to greater publick Inconveniencies. Such Purchases are
therefore as strictly prohibited as the Grants, and in one Respect the
Restraint is carried still further: for even those Lands which lie within the
Limits where Settlement is allowed, but which are reserved to the Indians,
may not be bought by Individuals; and if the present Possessors should at
any Time be inclined to dispose thereof, the Proclamation directs, that the
same shall be purchased only for the Use and in the Name of the Crown, at
some public Meeting of the said Indians to be held for that Purpose, by the
Governors of the Colonies respectively within which they shall lie. But none
of these Provisions are intended to fix Bounds to the British Empire in
America: The Proclamation does not leave room for the Supposition that the
Prohibitions are to be permanent: on the contrary, it declares in express
Terms that they are only for the present, and till his Majesty’s Pleasure shall
be further known; for tho’ the Circumstances of that Country require them
now, yet it may and I doubt not that it will hereafter appear desireable to
pass these Boundaries upon many Occasions, and to make Settlements in
remote Countries, for particular purposes: but this should always be a

Measure of Government, prudently concerted, and cautiously executed; not
left to the Decision of a single Governor, and much less to the interested
Views of any Individual or Sett of Individuals.
The selfish and inconsiderate Pursuits of private Persons, have already
involved the Colonies in many Disputes with the Indians; and Objects of
much less Importance than the Acquisition of Lands, have been productive
of infinite Mischiefs. The itinerant Traders among these ignorant people,
have been guilty of such Frauds and Abuses, as to create a general Distrust
of our national Faith, and frequently to occasion Animosities for a long time
irreconcileable. To guard against such Evils for the Future, by preventing
improper Persons from being concerned in that Barter, which is their only
Commerce, it is ordered by the same Proclamation, that every Person who
engages in it, shall take out a Licence from the Governor for that purpose,
and give Security to observe such Regulations, as may from time to time be
thought proper for the Benefit of the Indian Trade. The Provision for future
Regulations, gives Reason to hope that some are in view; and indeed many
will be necessary to secure the public tranquility, and to make all the
Advantage that may be made of such an Intercourse, tho’ the want of
certain Information, and the late Disturbances in those Parts, may have
hitherto rendered it impossible to establish them; for it is a Work of
Delicacy, as an Error once committed cannot easily be retracted; and the
Opinion, which from thence would be conceived of their new Neighbours,
would not soon be removed among these Barbarians: yet now that they
seem inclined to be quiet, I hope the first Opportunity will be taken to put
their Trade upon such a Footing, as will make it a Bond of Union, not a
Source of Depredations.
Security both from the Incursions of the Indians, and from the more
regular Attacks of other Enemies, will greatly promote the Settlement of the

new Colonies; for Planters will value Property there much higher, and be
more sollicitous to acquire it, when they observe that in the Disposition of
the Forces in America, so many Regiments are stationed in Quebec and the
Floridas: And when they see from the Advertisements in the public Papers
for transporting Cannon and Ordnance Stores thither, that Measures are
taken for putting those Provinces in a State of Defence; but the
Circumstance, which will be the most powerful Inducement to Foreigners to
resort thither, and which Englishmen before they embarked would expect to
be certain of, arises from his Majesty’s paternal Care for the Security of the
Liberties and Properties of those who shall become Inhabitants of those
Colonies. The Freedom and other Benefits of the British Constitution are
promised to them, and Directions given to the Governors (as the
Proclamation declares) in the Letters Patent by which their respective
Governments are constituted, that so soon as the State and Circumstances
of the said Colonies will admit thereof, they shall with the Advice and
Consent of the Members of the Council, summon general Assemblies, in the
same Manner as in the other royal Governments; which Assemblies in
concurrence with the Governor and Council, are to make Laws, as near as
may be agreeable to the Laws of England, and under such Regulations and
Restrictions as are used in the other Colonies.
The Circumstances last mentioned relate equally to the Government of
Grenada. The same Assurances are given, that a Constitution similar to that
of Great Britain, shall be formed there; and the same or greater Care is
taken to provide for the Security of those Islands; but in every other respect,
a Policy, almost opposite to that which is proper for the Acquisitions in
America, must be observed towards those in the West Indies. The
characteristic Distinctions, between the two Countries, have been taken
Notice of already; and the least Reflection upon those that have been

mentioned, will satisfy a very cursory Observer, that more is requisite than
merely to provide Inhabitants for the Islands, where Property does not
consist so much in Land, as in the Stock that is upon it; Conditions of
Culture are annexed to the Sale, and the strongest Pledge a Man can give of
his having Substance sufficient for such a Cultivation, is his advancing Part
of that Substance on the Speculation of the Profits he may make of it; for a
Purchaser certainly thinks himself that he is, and most probably will be
found to be equal to the Undertaking; no Precautions could have made
Grantees equally responsible to the Public for the due Improvement of such
valuable Property. The Objects of Acquisition would have been in reality so
great, and in Appearance so much greater, that all Sorts of Impositions,
Interest, and Importunity, would have been used, in order to obtain them;
and where these had not prevailed, it would still have been impossible to fix
the Proportions of the Allotments to the Abilities of the Petitioners; which
will now be ascertained to some Degree of Accuracy by the private Interest
of every Purchaser, as he must suffer himself if he exceeds the Bounds
which his Fortune prescribes to him. But their Numbers would be small, if
none were admitted who had not an immediate Command of Money,
sufficient to answer all the Demands of such Estates at once: The Buildings,
the Negroes, the Cattle, and other Stock which are requisite, will cost more
than the Lands themselves; and to enable the Purchaser to furnish
themselves with these, it is necessary to relieve them in the Payment of the
Purchase Money; Revenue itself is of less Consequence to the Public, even
at this Crisis of Distress, than an effectual and speedy Settlement of these
important Islands. His Majesty’s Proclamation of the 26th of March, has
therefore declared, that the Lands shall be sold by publick Auction, and the
Purchase-Money shall be paid in different Installments, Twenty per Cent.
immediately at the time of Sale, Ten per Cent. within one Year afterwards,

Ten per Cent. within the second Year, and Twenty per Cent. within every
successive Year, until the whole is paid. But such an Indulgence would be
Weakness, if Compliance with the Terms upon which it is granted, were not
rigorously enforced; he who is guilty of a Breach of them, justly forfeits all
Right to the Lands: and on that Condition he receives them.
Another Indulgence is converting part of the Purchase Money into an
Annual Quit Rent, the Value of which the Buyers will deduct out of the
Purchase Money; and they will thereby have still more of their Capital at
Liberty, to answer the Demand upon them, for Clearing and Stocking their
Lands. This Charge too is levied with a Lenity perfectly corresponding with
the Design of imposing it; it is not to be paid on the whole Lot at once; but
is gradually to creep upon it, in proportion as it becomes valuable; the Quit
Rents being declared by the Proclamation not to commence till Twelve
Months after the time each Acre shall be cleared, in conformity to the
Condition of Clearing, which I shall presently have occasion to mention.
But still to enable Men to do Right, is not to oblige them to it: The
same Means may also enable them to do Wrong, and then there will be
more reason to expect an Abuse, than a proper Application of the
Opportunity. Thus the Indulgences shewn to Purchasers with a View to
assist them in improving their Lands, might be perverted to a quite contrary
Effect, if no further Precautions were taken; for the Money thereby left in
their Hands, might be and would be frequently employed only in enlarging
their Purchases. All Tendencies to Monopoly are every where pernicious,
unless Circumstances make them necessary: But in a new Colony they may
be fatal; and must be detrimental: Too many Instances still subsisting of
their mischievous Effects occur in several of the Colonies, where large
Tracts of Land, which the publick Benefit requires should be cleared and
settled, are kept back from Sale by the Proprietors, on the prospect of their

daily becoming more and more valuable: And after this Experience it would
have been unpardonable, not to have provided against the Evil. The
Division of the Lands into Allotments of between One Hundred and Five
Hundred Acres, to which Dimensions it appears by the Proclamation they
will in general be confined, must be a Means of preventing it: As one of the
strongest Temptations to the extending of Territory, the Temptation of
Contiguity, will thereby be often removed: Since a cheap Purchase of one
Lot, will not at all secure an equally good Bargain for the next. The
Prohibition against any one Man’s buying more than Three Hundred Acres
in Dominica, or than Five Hundred in the other Islands, will have a still
greater Effect: The Restriction being enforced by the forfeiture of all the
Land which he shall Purchase beyond those Numbers, and of the Money he
shall have advanced for such Excess; I am not speaking of a few Acres too
much, by the Mistake of the Surveyor, and unknown to the Purchaser:
These cannot be liable to Forfeiture, for the Crown can never take
Advantage of an Error in its own Officer, to subject another person to a
Penalty: And such a Penalty can in no Case be extended beyond the subject
of the Provision it is intended to enforce; which Provision in the present
Case is against exceeding a specified Number of Acres: And the Excess
therefore is all that can be affected by the Penalty: But the best Security of
all arises from the Conditions of Culture: The Proclamation requires that
five Acres in every Hundred be cleared, every Year till half the Lot is
thereby brought into a state fit for Cultivation: But as Accidents and
Disappointments may sometimes make it difficult to comply with this
Condition, the Breach of it is not followed by so rigorous a Punishment as
Forfeiture: A pecuniary Penalty of Five Pounds every Year for every Acre
that is not cleared within the Term prescribed, is thought sufficient, as, no

Man will continue to pay so much annually for unprofitable Lands, which
he may make valuable by clearing.
One other Condition is required, which will contribute both to the
Improvement and to the Security of the Islanders: That every Purchaser of
cleared Lands shall constantly keep upon his Lot, One White Man, or Two
White Women, for every Hundred Acres contained in such Lot; and in
default thereof, shall be subject to the Payment of Twenty Pounds per
annum for every White Woman, and Forty Pounds for every White Man,
that shall be wanting to compleat the Number. Any one who has the least
Acquaintance with the West Indies, is apprized of the Advantages arising
from White Servants both for Service and for Security. The only Question
with me is, whether the Penalty be heavy enough to enforce the Observance
of the Condition; for in Antigua and Barbadoes, where a like Regulation is
established under a Penalty of Forty Pounds currency, that Sum has been
found to be inadequate: Very few of the Planters have their full
Complement; instead of providing all, they pay the Penalty for some, which
on every Estate are constantly deficient: And this is now got into so regular
a Course, as to become a settled Fund of their Revenue; so that the Penalty
instead of enforcing the Law, is perverted into a Mode of Taxation: That
imposed by the Proclamation is indeed to be paid in Sterling Money, but
whether the difference between that and Currency will be great enough, to
make the same Regulation effectual in the one, which for want of being
more strongly enforced, has not been observed in the other Colonies, cannot
be determined upon Speculation, but must be left to the decision of Time
and Experiment.
Yet even if it should compel all the Planters to keep their proper
Number of White Servants, that Number would not amount to so many
White Inhabitants, as the safety of the Islands require. The Invitation given

to poor Settlers by Grants of from Ten to Thirty Acres, will I hope supply
the Deficiency; and the Expectation is so far well grounded, that a Policy
similar to this has made Barbadoes the best peopled Island in all the West
Indies. The Planters there are excused from keeping White Servants, by
making small Grants to such poor Settlers: Two of these are deemed equal
to Three White Servants; and by such a Substitution relieve from a Burthen
the Estate which they improve. In these ceded Islands the White Servants
are retained, and at the same time poor Settlers are invited by the Provision
that is made for them: Which is so ample, that they will not long remain
meer Cottagers, tho’ they may be really poor Settlers in their Beginnings. A
small Number of Acres well improved there, is no inconsiderable Property;
tho’ it will not raise the Possessors above the Rank they were born to, it will
furnish them with all the Comforts and Conveniencies which are suitable to
their Condition, and with many more than usually belong to it: Some of the
Wood they are to clear will probably be of Value to sell; the rest will suffice
to build their little Tenements, to make their Fences, to furnish them with a
Thousand convenient Accomodations, and to supply all their moderate
Demands. The Products of their small Domains will not indeed be those by
which we are apt too indiscriminately to estimate West India Estates: Such
Inhabitants as these must not expect to mimick the Opulence of other
Planters; for the Lands allotted to them will hardly be of those Soils which
are proper for Sugar: But they may raise Coffee, Cocoa, Cotton, Ginger and
Tobacco; in process of time perhaps some Indigo; and at all times
Provisions: Whatever they raise will all be their own, whatever
Improvements they make will be for the Benefit of themselves and their
Families.
A poor Settler, who has but ten Acres, will find himself greatly
superior to any English Labourer; he that has thirty allotted to him, will be

equal to many English Farmers; and Men of this Rank in Life having some
Stake to lose, and yet being inured, by their Circumstances, to Hardiness
and Labour, will constitute a Militia, which may be always relied on, to
suppress domestic Disturbances among the Negroes, or to repel foreign
Invasions; but these Lots are to be given to those only who really mean to
reside upon them; the Test of their Intention is their taking actual Possession
themselves, within three Months from the Date of the Grant, and continuing
to occupy and improve the same, for twelve successive Months. And that
they may not be induced, by their Poverty, or tempted by an extraordinary
Price, to dispose of their Possessions, their Lots are unalienable by Sale for
Seven Years; this Condition is absolute; even the Governor cannot dispense
with it; but he may, by his Licence, permit Leases or Mortgages to be made
of them; and such Leases and Mortgages may be made without Licence, in
order to provide for a Child of the poor Settler. As to his Wife she wants no
Provision, till after his Death, and no Restraint is put upon his Disposition
by Will; nor do any of these Restrictions subsist for more than seven Years,
in which time, it is to be hoped, such Settlers will be fixed, and their Lots
will be improved to a Value, which will prevent improper Alienations of
them to their wealthier Neighbours, who, if not check’d by such
Precautions, would endeavour to monopolize to themselves, large Tracts of
Land, by taking Advantage of the Necessities of these indigent People.
The Lots being thus secured to the Persons for whose Use they are
designed, the only remaining Care is to see that they are properly improved;
and for this Purpose the Proclamation declares that Conditions are to be
inserted in the Grants, that each Grantee, being exempted from any
Burthens, for four Years, shall, at the Expiration of that Term, pay a QuitRent of Six-pence per Acre, for every Acre then cleared, and a Penalty of
two Shillings per Acre, for every Acre of Land uncleared; which said

Penalty of two Shillings per Acre, shall be reduced to Six-pence per Acre, as
the Land shall be cleared.
Regulations so wisely adapted to the End of peopling these Islands to a
great Degree with white Inhabitants, can hardly miss of their intended
Effects. And indeed, their Success is of the utmost Importance; for besides
the Advantages, which from thence result, to these in common with all West
India Islands, it is particularly necessary that Numbers of English
Protestants should be invited thither, especially to St. Vincents and
Dominica, which would be otherwise more exposed than any Settlements in
our Possession; for in the former are still remaining, considerable Tribes of
Carribee Indians, to the Number, it is supposed, of about four or five
Thousand, and who may be troublesome Enemies, if they are not by proper
Attention reconciled to their new Neighbours. Both in St. Vincents and
Dominica many French have settled; and tho’ their Possession is not
rightful, because it is contrary to Treaty; yet, since they are allowed to
remain there, it is necessary that they should be out-numbered by
Inhabitants, who can be more certainly relied on. It is, indeed, a doubted
Question, whether their Stay is to be wished; on the one hand, tho’ they are
an Acquisition of Subjects, yet they are Strangers to our Manners, our
Government, and our Religion; and till national Prejudices are removed,
cannot be hearty Friends to the Country they now owe Allegiance to: on the
other hand, they are there; they have Property; they have Wealth; they are
People, and People will be very much wanted; tho’ their Titles to their
Estates are bad in their Origin, for the King of France could not grant
where he had not Dominion; and tho’ therefore they cannot justly claim, yet
they may reasonably desire to retain the Lands, which have been cleared by
their Labour, and improved with their Substance; to insist on their
Departure, would be driving them to St. Lucia, where great Encouragement

is given to Settlers; and besides, Humanity revolts at the Idea of expelling
from their Habitations, Men hitherto inoffensive, and who may never be
pernicious, if time be allowed them to familiarize themselves to the
Customs and to adopt the Principles of their present Fellow-subjects. The
Experiment at least should be made, and those who are inclined to stay
should not be obliged to go, by being immediately and arbitrarily stripped
of their Possessions; at the same time they have no Pretence to expect that
the Lands they wrongfully occupy, should be given to them, when the
English can acquire no Property there but by Purchase. They cannot even
require to be at once considered as Natives of Great Britain, and to be put
on such a Footing, that the Government would have no Controul over them,
should their Disaffection descend to future Generations. For these Reasons,
I presume, it is, that a middle way is taken between confirming them in, and
expelling them from their Possessions.
The Proclamation declares that The Lands which at the time of the
Surrender of these Islands were, and still are in the Possession of such
French Inhabitants, shall be granted to them upon Leases for absolute or
renewable Terms, upon certain Conditions, and under proper Restrictions.
By accepting this Offer, they will retain their Property, under a better Title
than they can pretend to now. This is alone a Favour; and their subsequent
Behaviour may intitle them to greater. What Number will be induced on
these Conditions to continue, it is impossible to determine, or even to guess.
The two Islands are said to contain now about three Thousand French
Inhabitants, who employ above nine Thousand Negroes; some will not
forsake the Connections to which they have been habituated, and these are
certainly not worth retaining; others indifferent to either Form of
Government, will tarry where they are; and many will be sensible of the
Advantages arising from the Excellence of the British Constitution, the

Security which a Naval Power gives to its Colonies, and the Wealth of a
commercial Nation, extending to all its Dependants; These last will be as
valuable Subjects as the Natives of Great Britain.
The whole Service of disposing of the Lands in all these Islands, is to
be performed by Commissioners appointed for that Purpose. They are to
divide each Island into Parishes and Districts, of such Forms and
Dimensions, as the Circumstances of natural Boundaries, Contiguity and
Convenience require. In every Parish they must trace out a Town, its
Streets, its Market-place, and other public Places, and then parcel out the
Ground they shall destine for Habitations, into proper Allotments to build
on. To make these still more commodious, a small Field is to be annexed to
each, and both together to be sold, if the Land be clear’d, upon Condition to
pay the Purchase-money in the same Manner as is prescribed to the
Purchasers of Plantations; and a Quit-Rent of one Penny per Foot in Front
of each Town Lot, and Six-pence for every Acre of the Field, that
accompanies it; if the Land be uncleared, it is to be granted by the
Governor, upon Security given to build, to inclose and to fence, within such
time as to the Commissioners shall seem reasonable, and to pay the same
Quit-Rent as the others. The Commissioners are also to set apart such Spots
as shall be deemed proper for Batteries, Forts, and other military Purposes;
they are to direct the Highways from one Town to another, and to
accommodate every Plantation with easy Means of Access. They are to
reserve to the Crown certain Districts of Wood Lands, which by the Damps
continually exhaling from them, and the Clouds attracted by them, will
furnish a perpetual Supply of Moisture, to all the neighbouring Country, and
prevent the Drought to which Places in that Climate, when too much
cleared are frequently liable. These Reservations being made, and a suitable
Number of Acres also appropriated for the Grants which the Governor is to

make to poor Settlers, the Commissioners are to divide the Lands into
proper Allotments, and then to advertise, prepare for, and superintend the
Sale. They ought to be Men of Knowledge, Abilities, and Confidence, in
whom such a Trust is reposed, to contrive for the Accommodation of a
future Colony; to fix the Habitations, and to limit the Estates of the
Planters; to adjust publick and private Convenience; to mix the poor Settlers
with the rich, for their mutual Advantage; to distribute to each his
proportion of general Benefit; and to provide for the Cultivation, the
Commerce, and the Protection of such an important Dominion. This is to be
their liberal, but difficult, and perhaps hazardous Employ; for the Places
they are to visit like all others in that Climate which remain in their natural
State, must to a certain Degree be unhealthy. St. Vincents and Dominica,
where much is already clear’d, are less so than they were; but Tobago is
almost totally uncultivated, and the first Persons that go thither would be
greatly exposed, if Care were not taken to secure them from the Inclemency
of the Climate: It does Honour to the Humanity of those who provided
against it, by contracting, as the public Advertisements shew, for one
thousand Ton of Shipping to be station’d there for a year, on board of which
not only the Surveyors and Commissioners, but all Persons whose Duty
calls them thither in a civil or a military Capacity, all who repair thither to
view and to purchase the Lands, and in general the first Settlers, may, with
the Assistance of the Vessels which must occasionally lie there, be
conveniently accommodated; and every Body knows that the Unhealthiness
of the Climate is confined to the Land; at Sea, tho’ at ever so small a
Distance, the Air is always free from the noxious Vapours, which alone
occasion that Sickliness and Mortality.
It is another agreeable Circumstance to the Purchasers, that the
Commissioners are Gentlemen of such Characters, as leave no Reason to

apprehend that the Power reserved to the Crown of revoking their Acts, will
ever be exercised, tho’ former Abuses suggested such a general Precaution,
as a necessary Controul over their Conduct. Under them I doubt not the
Sales will be equitably made, and the Public will avail itself of the Fairness
of their Proceedings; for his Majesty, besides contributing out of the Duties
belonging to him in the new Acquisitions, towards the Support of their civil
Establishments, has been graciously pleased to give the Money arising from
these Sales to the Use of the Public: No Conjecture can as yet I suppose be
form’d of its Amount. Accident, Caprice, Plenty or Scarcity of Money at
the Time, and a thousand other Circumstances, will make it greater or less;
but at all Events the Purchase Money of so large a Quantity of Land so
valuable, cannot be inconsiderable. Tobago and St. Vincents are reckon’d to
be each of them as large as Barbadoes, and Dominica much larger; Some
Parts of Grenada too will come to Sale, which were never granted by the
King of France, or the Grants of which have been forfeited on Failure of
complying with the Conditions annexed to them: The whole of the new
Acquisitions are together of a greater Extent than all our former Possessions
in the West-Indies, exclusive of Jamaica, and are said to contain between
five and six thousand Acres: Of these indeed a great part, particularly in
Dominica, is mountainous Ground, of little Value for Sale; tho’ of
inestimable Importance to the adjacent Country, for which it preserves the
Seasons, sends forth Rivers, and affords the means of Defence; but still a
great Proportion of the whole is as rich a Soil as any in the West-Indies, and
being fresh Land, it will require less Expence, and at the same Time yield
Crops far more luxuriant, than the utmost efforts of Culture can produce
from an old Plantation: and tho’ it cannot be brought to Perfection as Sugar
Land, without a great Stock of Negroes and a considerable Charge in
building, in preparing the Ground, and other Articles; yet at a very

moderate Expence and in a very short time, it may be made fit for raising
Ginger, Cotton, Cocoa, Coffee, Indigo, and other Commodities, which will
amply compensate the Purchasers for the Money they may have expended,
and will moreover supply them with a Fund for the further Improvement of
their Estates, ’till they gradually become thoroughly stock’d, and in every
Respect well appointed Sugar Plantations; which the Owners will then find
they have acquired for a much less Sum upon the whole, than they must
have given for one of equal Income in any other Island; and that Money too
advanced at different Times and according to their own Convenience. But
besides this general Advantage, each Island has some peculiar
Circumstance to recommend it: The Situations of Grenada and Tobago will
give their Inhabitants Opportunities to carry on a most profitable Trade with
the Spanish Main: The former is besides possessed of two excellent
Harbours, capable of containing any Number of Ships of any Burthen, and
is never exposed to Hurricanes: It is already so far cultivated as to produce
about 10,000 Hogsheads of Sugar, 3,500,000 lb. of Coffee, and 200,000 lb.
of Cocoa, besides some Cotton and Indigo.
Tobago is represented as one of the finest Islands in the West-Indies,
and of such a Surface that a very small if any Part of it is unfit for
Cultivation.
St. Vincents is more hilly, but the cultivable Land is excellent, and so
much is already clear’d as to yield it is reckon’d about 40000 l. annually;
yet this is but a very small Proportion of the cultivable Land in the Island.
Still more is clear’d in Dominica, whose present Produce is valued at near
double that Sum; but the most material Advantage is Prince Rupert’s Bay,
which is capable of receiving and sheltering the largest Ships, and which
will certainly be the principal Station of the British Fleet in all subsequent
Wars, on Account of the Situation of the Island. It lies between Martinico

and Guadaloupe, and its Cruisers can always intercept the whole French
Trade, between those their principal Settlements: It is equally convenient
for protecting the British Islands against the Depredations of Privateers, or
more formidable Attacks: It is itself naturally strong, full of Posts, Defiles,
Gullies, Rivers, and Precipices, and particular Attention is shewn in his
Majesty’s Proclamation to the Peculiarity of its Situation, by directing that
the Lots which in the other Islands are in general to contain from one to
three hundred, with some few of five hundred Acres, shall in this be for the
most Part confined to between fifty and an hundred, but shall never exceed
three hundred Acres: By which Provision a greater Number of Whites will
be settled there than if the Lands were divided into larger Plantations, and
Dominica will not only be secure in itself, but formidable both to Martinico
and Guadaloupe. All these Circumstances of Advantage belonging to the
ceded Islands in general, and to each in particular being consider’d; and not
only unclear’d Lands, but great Quantities which have been clear’d, and
belong’d to French Inhabitants who have left or will leave them, or to
religious Communities, who cannot be allow’d to hold them by Lease or in
any Manner whatsoever, being to be sold; his Majesty’s gracious Gift to the
Public will appear to be an Object worthy of his Generosity, and of the
Gratitude of his People.
The several Steps above-mention’d with Respect to the Settlement of
our new Acquisitions, both in America and the West-Indies, seem to me to
have been so judiciously taken, that in all Probability these Accessions to
the British Dominion, will in a few Years be peopled, cultivated, and in
every Respect in the same Situation as our former Possessions. They will be
incorporated into the general System of the British Colonies, be affected by
the same Circumstances, and the Objects of the same Regulations. Their
great Interests too will be the same, and those are also the dearest Interests

of Great Britain; for to imagine that they can ever be separated, much less
that they can stand in Competition, is a narrow, superficial Idea. The British
Empire in Europe and in America is still the same Power: Its Subjects in
both are still thc same People; and all equally participate in the Adversity or
Prosperity of the whole. Partial Advantages that opposed the general Good,
would finally be detrimental to the Particulars who enjoyed them: The
Mother Country would suffer, if she tyrannized over her Colonies: The
Colonies would decline, if they distressed their Mother Country; for each is
equally important to the other, and mutual Benefits, mutual Necessity
cement their Connexion. It is an indisputable Consequence of their being
thus one Nation, that they must be govern’d by the same supreme
Authority, be subject to one executive Power in the King, to one legislative
Power in the Parliament of Great-Britain. Their Connexion would
otherwise be an Alliance, not a Union; and they would be no longer one
State, but a Confederacy of many: Local Purposes may indeed be provided
for by local Powers, but general Provisions can only be made by a Council
that has general Authority; that Authority vested by indefeasable right in
Parliament over all the Subjects of Great-Britain, wheresoever resident in
the British Dominions, and to which it is Rebellion to refuse Obedience, for
Parliament has never exempted any from the Submission they owe to it, and
no other Power can grant such an Exemption, appears from hence to be
founded not only upon just Right, but upon absolute Necessity. It has been
accordingly asserted and exercised without Interruption from the Time that
the Colonies became Objects of Attention; and must always subsist for the
enacting of such Laws as relate to the whole, and even for controuling any
particular Acts of local delegated Powers, which may contradict the general
Welfare.

The Necessity of such a Superintendance, in order to prevent the
Abuse of local tho’ legal Authority, was proved by an Instance, which was
under the Consideration of Parliament, during the last Sessions. The
extravagant Encrease of Paper Money in some Colonies, had ruin’d the
Credit of those where it was so multiplied, had embarrassed their Dealings
with the neighbouring Provinces, and was destructive to the British
Merchants who traded to America. These Bills were issued from Time to
Time, upon Loans, as the Services of the Year, the Exigencies of the
Government, or the Pretence of either, required. Funds were at the same
time created, sometimes of Land, and sometimes of Taxes, for the Payment
not only of the Interest annually, but of the Principal also at the End or
during the Continuance of the Terms, for which they were created: But
generally the Funds proved deficient, and the Bills consequently sunk in
Value: This however was the least of the Evils occasion’d by their Paper
Currency: Had their Discount stop’d here, it might have been born, or a
Remedy might have been, as it ought to have been, applied, by creating
additional Funds; but the contrary Measure was adopted: The Terms were
prolong’d, more Bills were issued on Funds deficient already, and the whole
Credit was hereby still further depreciated. To force these Bills into
Currency, they were made a legal Tender, and that compleated the Mischief.
Publick Credit was ruined, for the Payment of its Debts was postponed
beyond the Time limited for discharging them; or made in Bills so sunk in
Value, as not to be equal to a fifth, or even in some Cases to a tenth, of the
Sterling Money advanc’d by the Creditors: Private Transactions were at the
same Time equally affected: No Man knew what he should receive upon
Payments to be made at any distant Time: All Contracts became uncertain;
all Returns in Trade precarious; while the few Persons who concerted these
Measures, had frequent Opportunities of making a private Advantage of the

publick Calamity. From them who had caused the Evil, a Remedy could not
be expected: It was their Influence that had led to Acts, Orders, Resolutions,
and Votes of Assembly, making and declaring such Bills to be legal Tender
in Payments of Money. The Interposition of the Parliament of Great-Britain
therefore became necessary; it had interfer’d before with Respect to the
four New-England Governments, and by a salutary Act made in 24 Geo. II.
to regulate and restrain Paper Bills in those Colonies, the Credit of such
Bills was retriev’d, and their Currency settled. To check the same Abuses in
all the other Colonies, and to diffuse the Benefits of the like Provisions over
all the British Dominions, an Act was passed during the last Sessions, by
which, such Proceedings as have been above-mention’d, are strictly
prohibited in all the Colonies, and every Act, Order, Resolution, or Vote of
Assembly which shall be made to prolong the legal Tender of any such Bills
now subsisting and current, beyond the Times fixt for discharging the same;
or to create or issue Paper Bills of any Kind or Denomination, declaring
them to be legal Tender in Payment of any Bargains, Contracts, Debts,
Dues, or Demands whatsoever, is declared to be null and void. By which
vigorous and seasonable Exertion of supreme Authority, this enormous
Abuse will be prevented for the future, and the Bills issued by the
Government there, being charged upon adequate Funds, and supported by
publick Faith, will preserve their proper Value, during the whole Time of
their Circulation; no Person being obliged from henceforth to take
depreciated Money in Payment, the Creditors of the publick will receive as
much as they advanced, and those to whom Debts are owing on private
Transactions will really recover the whole that is due to them.
But without recurring to instances of Misconduct in the general
Assemblies of certain Colonies, it is certain that however enlarged their
Views may be, however upright their Intentions, yet their Powers must

frequently fail in great and extensive Operations; confined as they are
within the Limits of their respective Provinces, they can never attempt any
Measures, which depend for their Success upon the concurrence of others;
much less will they venture to sacrifice their own partial Advantages to the
general good, when they cannot be sure that their Concessions will obtain
the Ends for which they were intended. The Parliament of Great Britain
alone can command the Acquiescence of all, and is therefore alone able to
devise, conduct, and execute such Measures, as equally relate to all. This
Power it has at all times exercised with impartial Sway, and has extended its
parental Care to every part of the British Dominions; as each has on
different Occasions particularly called for its Attention. No Preference, no
Privilege, no Exemption is allowed to any, not even to Great Britain, when
her particular Interests seem incompatible with this greater System: She has
frequently engaged in the Defence of her most distant Dominions, with
more alacrity than the Provinces themselves that were immediately
attacked: Her Debts have been accumulated by the Protection she has
afforded her Colonies in times of War; her Revenues have been freely
applied in times of Peace, in Bounties and numberless other Expences for
their Encouragement and Support: She has even checked her own
Cultivation for the Advancement of theirs, as in the instancy of Tobacco,
which because it is a staple Commodity of some of the Colonies, is
prohibited to be raised in this Country, except in small Quantities, and for
particular purposes. But the Principles are great, the Policy is right, upon
which this conduct is founded: The prevalence of these Principles at present
is the illustrious Characteristic of the Times: No period of our History can
within the same compass boast of so many Measures, with regard to the
Colonies, founded upon Knowledge, formed with Judgment, and executed
with Vigour, as have distinguished the beginning of his Majesty’s Reign.

The glorious Peace that ushered it in so auspiciously to his People, is a heap
of Concessions forced from our Enemies, in favour of the British
Plantations. The Tranquility it procured us has been employed in improving
the Advantages both of our new and our former Possessions: In the
prosecution of which great Work, the true Principles of Commerce have
been attended to with so much discernment and care; the Interests of the
Mother Country and those of the Colonies have been blended with so much
skill; and their Union has been strengthened by so many Bonds of
Connection, Obligation and Advantage; that every good Subject, whether in
Europe or in America, must with success and stability to Measures, so
wisely, so impartially adapted to the Benefit of all.
The Alteration made in the Duty upon Beaver Skins is one of these
Measures, and one that is of great Consequence to a very valuable Article
of American Produce, and to a considerable Branch of British Manufacture:
That Commodity is absolutely necessary to the making of fine Hats; no
other Material can supply the want of it; and as the Animal is not to be
found in any other part of the World but North America, the Reduction of
Canada has given us the entire Monopoly of it. The Acquisition has been
made most seasonably for the preservation of the Manufacture of Hats,
which had been long declining, and would perhaps in a few Years have
been totally lost as an article of Exportation: For our Neighbours can
generally underwork us; and if they can be furnished with the raw Materials
upon the same Terms, will always be able to undersell us: Yet the Duty
upon Beaver was laid on in such a manner, that they were supplied with the
Material thro’ Great Britain, at a cheaper Rate than we could retain it for
our own Consumption: Seven-pence was imposed upon every Skin
imported from America, and a Drawback of Four-pence was allowed upon
Exportation: Those that were used here were by this means charged with

Three-pence per Skin more, than other Nations paid, when supplied from
hence; and the natural Consequence must be the Encouragement of their
Manufactory to the prejudice of our own. In fact, the French had gradually
gained upon us in every Market: The Manufactory was thriving in Portugal,
and there was great reason to apprehend that it would soon be established in
Spain, while our own Exportation of Hats was reduced above one half in
Ten Years: That this great Diminution was not occasioned by a decrease in
the Consumption, but only by a Change of the hands that were to supply it,
appeared from the Exports of the Skins being now even greater than the
Imports, of which they used to be only one Half, tho’ the Imports were
encreased from little more than 62,000, in thc Year 1750, to above 128,000,
in the Year 1763: Smuggling inwards supplied the Excess of the Exports
over the Imports, and the number of Skins sent abroad last Year was so
large, that had they been made into Hats here, those Hats would have
produced to the Nation Sixty or Seventy Thousand Pounds more than the
Skins sold for. To remedy these Evils, an Act was passed during the last
Sessions, whereby the Duty is transferred from the Importation to the
Exportation of Beaver Skins: A Penny only of the former Seven-pence is
retained upon those Imported, in order to bring all to a regular Entry, and to
be a Check upon the Trade, from whence a Judgment may at any time be
formed of the State it is in; And Seven-pence is on the other hand imposed
upon every Skin that shall be exported. The Remedy is simple, and
therefore the more likely to be effectual; but if the Six-pence which
Foreigners must pay for every Skin they use in Addition to its Purchase
here, does not turn the Scale in our favour, a still heavier Burthen must be
imposed; and the Duty certainly will then, it may now be the means of
recovering and improving a considerable Manufacture almost lost; at the
same time that a Revenue is raised upon the Consumption of Foreigners,

who are absolutely dependant upon us for their Supply; and our Colonies
are also relieved in a material Article of their Produce.
The Indulgence shewn to them in taking off the Duty upon Whale
Fins, is of still greater Consequence to America, and would be thought a
Sacrifice of the Interests of Great-Britain to those of the Colonies, if she
could consider them as distinct and independent of each other. The Whale
Fishery has been long the Object of public Attention, and many Provisions
have at different Times been made for the Recovery of it from the Dutch,
for our own Consumption at least, which to our great Disgrace and
Detriment, used to be entirely and has even till now been partially supplied
from Holland. For this Purpose the Rigour of the Act of Navigation was
relaxed, and the Trade laid open to all the Inhabitants of England, whether
Natives or Foreigners, free of Custom by 25 Car. II. c. 6. but by the same
Act Fifty Shillings per Ton is imposed on Whale Fins caught by Ships
belonging to the Plantations, unless the same be imported by Ships
belonging to England, in which Case it is reduced to Twenty five Shillings
per Ton. This Duty call’d the old Subsidy is no very great Burthen, as a Ton
of Whale Bone may fairly be estimated upon an Average at 250 l. but a
heavier Imposition of Three-pence per Pound weight was laid on by 11 and
12 W. III. c. 21. upon all Whale Fins imported, which entirely ruin’d the
Fishery, and made it necessary first by 10 G. I. c. 12. and afterwards by 5 G.
II. c. 28, continued by several subsequent Acts, to take off the Duty; but this
Relief was confined to such as should be caught in the Greenland Seas,
Davis’s Streights, or the Seas adjoining thereto. The whole Burthen still
continued upon the American Fishery, which indeed was at that time too
inconsiderable an Object to attract the publick Notice, and on the same
Account was not included in the Encouragement which was afterwards
given to the Greenland Whale Fishery: for the merely freeing it from Duty,

being insufficient to establish it, the Assistance of Bounties was applied;
first of Twenty Shillings for every Ton of Shipping employed therein, by 6
G. II. c. 23, and afterwards of Forty Shillings per Ton, by 22 G. II. c. 4. by
which Encouragement, the Purposes of all these Endeavours were at last in
a great Measure answered, and the British Whale Fishery began to cope
with the Dutch, or at least to intrench on their Monopoly. The Price of Bone
has in Consequence thereof been reduced from 700 l. to 250 l. per Ton, and
that of Oil from 20 l. to 16 per Ton. The Oil we procured has generally been
equal to our own Consumption, and sometimes foreign Markets have been
supplied out of our Abundance; but we have never been able to provide
ourselves with a sufficient Quantity of Bone: Between sixty and seventy
Ton having still been annually imported from Holland, which at the lowest
valuation must be reckon’d 16000 l. or 17000 l. per Annum. In this State of
the Trade the Gulph of St. Lawrence becomes Part of the British
Dominions, and a great Whale-Fishery is discover’d there, which was
perhaps unknown to its former Possessors: The Industry of the Americans
has improv’d it so much, that from 7 Cwt. 0 qrs. 17 lb. of Bone, which was
all they imported in 1759, they in 1762 sent hither 335 C. 2 qrs. 5 lb. and in
1763, 1546 C. 3 qrs. 13 lb. and this rapid Progress has been made under the
Pressure of a heavy Duty, while at the same Time, the Rival Trade to
Greenland was supported by a very liberal Bounty. But the Inequality is
now removed, and an Act was pass’d during the last Sessions, by which all
Duties are taken off from Whale Fins imported from America, except the
light Charge of the old Subsidy. The Bounty upon the Greenland Fishery is
indeed continued by another Act ’till the Year 1768, but it will not be long
or often demanded; for the American Whale Fishery now freed from its
Burthen, will soon totally overpower the other, and this Indulgence can
therefore only be meant in Favour of the Parties who have hitherto been

concerned in the latter, and who are intitled to the Assistance of the Publick
to enable them to retire gradually, instead of being forced to an abrupt
Determination of a Trade, which was beneficial, tho’ it is now become
useless to the State. A Year or two more will entirely put an End to it; and
that in the Gulph of St. Lawrence will immediately furnish as much as was
ever brought hither from Greenland, and probably far more; so as not only
to make any Supply from Holland unnecessary, but to enable us in Process
of Time to sell at foreign Markets upon cheaper Terms than those who fetch
the Commodity from Greenland can afford it; for the American Whale
Fishery being carried on in Seas little encumber’d with Ice, and
consequently requiring fewer Precautions in the Construction and
Equipment of the Ships, and in the Choice and the Number of the Crew;
being open for a much longer Season; and at all Times less liable to
Accidents, Disappointments, and Losses than the other; and the Ships
employ’d in it having Opportunities to make Returns both Ways in their
Voyages; with all these Advantages, it must necessarily in Time prevail
over that which has hitherto flourish’d only because there was no other: but
whatever may be the Event upon this Speculation, should our own
Consumption alone be supplied, even in that confined View it was right to
prefer the American to the British Whale Fishery. Tho’ we resign a valuable
Branch of Trade in their Favour, a Trade whose Produce may be valued at
Three Hundred Thousand Pounds a Year, and in which three thousand
Seamen, besides a great Number of Shipwrights, and other Artificers were
employ’d; yet the Preference is given upon truly national Considerations,
when the Inhabitants of America and of Europe are look’d upon as one
People: It then becomes a general Benefit to promote that Fishery which
has so many Advantages over the other; and which will maintain itself

without the Support of Bounties, the Expence of which was near Thirty
thousand Pounds per Annum.
Tho’ this Accession to the Whale Fishery, that of Seals and Sea Cows,
the Monopoly of Beaver, and many other important Branches of
Commerce, are particularly Parts of our new Acquisitions, yet the Profits
arising from them, and the Benefits resulting from the Encouragement
given to them, are by no Means confined to the Inhabitants of the newly
acquired Territories: Other Colonies will enjoy an equal, some a greater
share: The Beaver, for Instance, is not the Produce of Canada alone, and the
Vent of it only down the River St. Laurence; but the Reduction of Canada
having open’d our Communication with all the Countries where it is
produced; it may now be brought over the Lakes, and down the Rivers, to
New-England, New-York, and perhaps to still more Southern Colonies;
whose Merchants will enrich themselves with the Spoils of Desarts, they
hardly knew before. The Whale Fishery seems indeed more local, but even
that will be carried on by Ships sent from Ports far distant from the Gulph
of St. Laurence, and a great Part of the Coast of North-America will be
engaged in so beneficial an Adventure: By them it has been increas’d to its
present Extent, for the Inhabitants of the Shores of the Gulph evidently
cannot have been sufficient for what has been done already. But even those
who are too far removed to be immediately active in the Fishery itself, will
be sensible of its Effects, and partake of the Generosity of Great Britain.
The Profits of the Colonies that are engaged in it, will circulate thro’ all the
others, from whom they will demand, as their Wealth and their Inhabitants
increase, larger Supplies of the Commodities which they do not produce
themselves; for hardly any one of the Plantations can pretend to furnish all
the Necessaries, none all the Conveniencies of Life; and for the
Superfluities, the richest and most fruitful must fetch them from many and

from distant Quarters. Each has its several Staple; each its several
Delicacies; which by their constant Intercourse are freely communicated
from the one to the other; but throng to those Marts, to which large
Demands, and quick Returns, or in one Word, Riches invite them. Trade
thus diffusing over the whole, the Prosperity of every Part, not only
adjacent Provinces, but the most distant, those apparently most opposite,
even the West-Indies and North-America, mutually participate in the
Advances they each of them make in their particular Branches of Culture
and of Commerce. Great-Britain herself enjoys, and both in Trade and in
Strength feels herself benefited by the Welfare of every particular Colony.
How much more must the Colonies, which are as near in Affinity, and so
much nearer in Neighbourhood, interchangeably contribute to the
Advantage of each other?
In this View the Indulgence shewn to Carolina and Georgia, with
Respect to the Exportation of Rice, which at first Sight may seem entirely
local, if traced thro’ all its distant Effects, will appear to be a general
Benefit: Rice being an enumerated Commodity could not be carried from
the Place of its Growth, unless to some other British Plantation, or to the
Kingdom of Great Britain: but the Rigour of this Restriction has been
relaxed, and by 3 Geo. II. c. 28. and 27 Geo. II. c. 18, it is allowed to be
carried directly from the Plantations, to any Part of Europe lying Southward
of Cape Finisterre; the Charge of double Freight being thus taken off, Spain
and Portugal who used to bring all their Rice from the Levant, receive it
now from our Colonies, and consume 20000 Barrels every Year. The half
Subsidy upon it yields some Revenue; the Bulkiness of the Commodity
employs a great Quantity of Shipping; and the Demand for it has been one
great Means of raising Carolina to its present flourishing Condition. But
surely every Reason that could suggest the granting this Permission with

respect to any part of Europe, urges the Propriety of extending it to Foreign
Plantations; for tho’ Rice be a very desireable Food in such Climates, it is
not absolutely necessary; the want of it may be supplied by other kinds of
Vegetable Provisions: And the Vent therefore will depend upon the
Cheapness. If the Voyage round by England can be saved, and the
Commodity thereby afforded on reasonable Terms, vast Quantities may be
disposed of amongst the foreign Plantations; for in the short time that
Guadalupe and Martinico were in our Possession, 14,000 Barrels were
consumed there; and an Application was made last Winter for a Contract to
deliver 40,000 Barrels in three Years at Cayenne, which could not be
complied with, unless some Alteration were made in the Law; the French
too are not the only Purchasers that may be expected; other Nations will be
desirous of procuring Rice for their Settlements from the same Quarter, and
the Negroes in all these Settlements will take off the Broken and Mowburnt
Rice, which will make the good Rice cheaper, and is one Advantage that a
West India Market for this kind of Provisions has over an European. To
allow therefore of its immediate Exportation thither from the places of its
Growth, will be a great Encouragement to a Staple Commodity of two of
our Colonies: And the measure is adopted, not upon Speculation, but on a
certainty: We have no Experiment to make; we are only to accept of an
Invitation, and a new Branch of Commerce is obtained: an Improvement
will at the same time be made in the American Revenue, for the Act of the
last Sessions which grants the Liberty of Exporting Rice from SouthCarolina and Georgia to any part of America to the Southward of those
Provinces, retains the half Subsidy, which amounts to about Seven-pence
upon every Hundred Weight of Rice thus exported, and is the same Duty as
is paid upon that which is carried directly to the Southward of Cape

Finisterre, or being brought to Great Britain, is Exported from hence to any
other Country.
Other Commodities, the Produce of the Colonies, but of still greater
and more extensive Importance, both to the Colonies and to Great Britain,
have this Year received that Encouragement, they stood so much in need of,
and so richly deserved: The Bounties upon Hemp and Flax, which were
given first by 3 & 4 Ann. c. 10. and continued by several other Acts, had
been of late Years suffered to drop, and the Act by which they were last
given, was expired: The Culture of Hemp did not succeed: Hardly any was
Imported; and the Bounty being never called for, fell into Oblivion; but the
encrease of the Colonies having enabled them to attend to it again, and
annually to raise large Quantities; the Renewal of the Bounty will be a
probable means of procuring from thence in Course of Time sufficient for
our whole Consumption, tho’ it amount at a Medium of the last Ten Years,
to more than 300,000l. per Annum. To raise so considerable an Article of
Naval Stores within ourselves; to shake off our Dependance for a precarious
Supply upon other Countries, who by some unexpected fluctuation in
political Connections, may become adverse to these Kingdoms, and will
then be able to disappoint us in a Time of Crisis, or even to occasion the
Distress which they will not relieve; to wrest in short out of the hands of
other States, be they ever so friendly, such an undue Influence over all our
Operations, is a great object to a Maritime Power: And to procure so
extensive a Branch of Trade; is equally interesting to a Commercial People:
But when such an Acquisition is in view, Great Britain does not morosely
grudge to the Colonies the greater share of it: She does not tenaciously
adhere to her own Interests alone: On the contrary, she freely gives up the
Revenue arising from the Importation of Foreign Hemp: And liberally
grants out of her other Revenues the Bounties of Eight Pounds per Ton for

Seven Years, of Six Pounds per Ton for the next Seven Years, and of Four
Pounds for another Term of Seven Years more, on Hemp imported from
America. The same Bounties on the like Quantities of Flax imported from
thence, are, so far as that also is a Naval Store, founded upon the same
Principles; but considering Flax as the principal Material in the
Manufactory of Linen, the Encouragement given to the Importation of it
will contribute to another great End, which I shall presently have occasion
to explain more fully, when the Duty upon Linen, with which it is
connected, will, together with the other Duties which it has been thought
expedient to impose, be particularly considered.
The Circumstances of the Times, the Necessities of this Country, and
the Abilities of the Colonies, concur in requiring an American Revenue;
Great Britain strained to the utmost of her Strength, sinks under the
Exertion, and will hardly recover by Rest alone, without the Aid of
Remedy: her funded Debt increased by 65,061,960l. 7s. 10d. for the
Expences of the last War, amounts now, the 1,000,000l. Civil List Debt
being included, to the enormous Sum of 130,586,968l. 4s. 0¼. upon which
4,716,681l. 4s. 11½. Interest is annually paid: her unfunded Debt at the End
of the War was no less than 9,061,416l. 11s. 9d. of which 2,464,517l. 13s.
10d. is this Year paid off, and 3,483,553l. 1s. 10d. is for the present charged
upon the Sinking Fund; but the whole must be paid, before that Fund can be
applied to the Diminution of the funded Debt: her Peace Establishment is at
the same Time increased by the Necessity of keeping an Army in America,
of augmenting her Fleet, and of providing for the many Expences of her
additional Dominions. The whole Annual Revenue that is necessary to
answer all these Demands, amounts to near 3,000,000l. and is raised by
many, and some of them burthensome Taxes, which are imposed, not only
upon the Luxuries of the Rich, but which all the Researches of Invention,

and all the Resources of Finance, could not find Means to keep off from the
Consumption of the Poor; and great Part of them are not meer Expedients
for a present Exigency, but are entailed upon our Posterity perhaps to
distant Generations. The whole of this vast Revenue is raised in Great
Britain, and is paid by the Inhabitants of Great Britain, expecting such
Duties as are levied or retained upon Exportation to foreign Countries, or to
the Colonies, and which after all Draw-backs and Bounties are allowed,
make but a small Proportion of the whole; and even these, tho’ produced on
the Consumption of others, are still a Burthen upon the Trade of GreatBritain; while the Colonies in North America, near two Million of British
Subjects, an opulent, commercial, thriving people, and who have been
enabled by the Patronage of their Mother Country to extend their Trade and
their Cultivation over that fertile Continent, supported by her Wealth,
protected by her Power, and blessed with her Laws, contribute to the
national Expence by Taxes raised there, no more than seven or eight
Hundred Pounds per Ann. and the Colonies in the West-Indies, where, tho’
their Numbers are less, their Riches are greater, have remitted no more than
eleven or twelve Hundred Pounds per Ann. to England: The whole
Remittance from all the Colonies at an Average of thirty Years has not
amounted to 1900l. a year, and to make it still more ridiculous, the
Establishment of Officers necessary to collect this 1900l. amounts to 7600l.
per Annum.
There is no Occasion to accompany this Account with any
Observations; only to state it, is to prove the Necessity of an additional
American Revenue; they can certainly bear more; they ought to raise more:
The Subjects and the Mode of new Impositions are therefore the only
Considerations; but to lay them on Subjects, and in such a Manner as would
not be oppressive to those who were to pay them, would not be dangerous,

in the delicate Situation of the Colonies, with respect to their Trade, their
Improvements, and their Connection with the Mother Country, and would at
the same time apply equally to all, in their different Stages of Progress from
Infancy to Maturity, was a Measure that required the utmost Caution,
Circumspection, and Care: It came under the Deliberation of Parliament the
last Winter, and by their Wisdom an Act was passed to be the Foundation of
an American Revenue, which is formed upon such Principles, that the
Increase in the Revenue, which may be expected from it, tho’ very
considerable, seems the least important Object; so very judicious, so very
interesting are the several Provisions of this Act, for the Purposes of
Commerce and Colonization.
To encourage the Consumption of our own Produce and our own
Manufactures, in preference to those of other Countries, has been at all
times an undisputed Maxim of Policy; and for this Purpose, high Duties and
even Prohibitions have been laid upon foreign Commodities, while
Bounties have been granted on our own. The general Tendency of the Act
now before us is to extend the same Principle to the American, as is
followed in respect to our home Trade and Consumption. One general
Clause with this View diminishes the Draw-back allowed on Reexportation, and enacts that no Part of the Rate or Duty, commonly called
The Old Subsidy, shall be repaid or drawn back, for any foreign Goods of
the Growth, Production, or Manufacture of Europe, or the East-Indies,
which shall be exported from this Kingdom to any British Colony, Wines,
white Callicoes, and Muslins, only excepted, which are otherwise provided
for. In many Articles this will give a Turn in favour of British Produce and
Manufactures; in some, it may be an Inducement to the Colonies to apply to
the Cultivation of Commodities, they may very well raise, but have hitherto
neglected; but in none can it be oppressive to retain all the Old Subsidy, the

whole of which is a very low Duty, and half of it is retained already; these
foreign Commodities will still come much cheaper to the Americans than
they do to their fellow Subjects here, who pay on almost all of them some,
and on many of them very large additional Duties, and indeed can in
general afford to pay more. The Revenue too of the Customs here will be
increased, from the great Quantity of Goods, upon which this saving of the
Draw-back will be made; and tho’ it would be tedious to enter into the
Detail of the numberless Articles, and the various Rates upon the several
Articles that will be affected by it, without which Detail, no exact
Calculation can be made of the Produce to be expected from this Duty; yet
the general Computation, and which certainly is very moderate, that the
Goods imported annually from Great Britain into America, amount in Value
to the Sum of 1,400,000l. and that one Third of these are foreign Goods reexported from hence, make a very low Duty upon so great a Consumption,
no contemptible Object; but besides these, it is commonly supposed that
foreign Goods to the Amount of 700,000l. are annually smuggled into the
Colonies, and should the Regulations, I shall presently mention, to have
been made for the Prevention of all illicit Trade, have the Effect that is to be
wished, to bring the greater Part of these too in the regular Channel thro’
Great Britain, in which Case the whole Subsidy would be retained on them
also, which now yield nothing, then the Amount of this Duty upon all, will
really be considerable.
Among the Goods that are the Subjects of this Tax are the foreign
Linens, which thereby become less merchantable for this Trade, than the
British; on the other hand, a rival Manufactory is apprehended in America
itself, and inhancing the Price of Linens, exported from hence, will, it is
said, be a Means of encourageing it. For myself, I own I am under no such
Apprehensions, and the Facts that are alledged to support that Opinion,

seem to me to prove the contrary. Great Quantities of Linen it is true are
made there already; but then the Manufactory is almost confined to
Pensylvania, and there the weaving Part of it is carried on entirely by the
Germans, who transport themselves thither in great Numbers every Year,
and carry their Mystery with them. For a present Subsistance on their
Arrival, they follow the Business they were bred to, but as soon as they get
enough to enable them to settle a Piece of Land, (which they soon may,
when they can earn Three Shillings and Six-pence per diem,) they find
farming the more agreeable and more advantageous Employment: they turn
to it themselves, and train their Children to that only. A Manufactory thus
deserted by those who are engaged in it on the first Opportunity that offers,
and dependant upon fortuitous Circumstances for Existence, can never be
considered as flourishing and established: Nor is there any Prospect of its
being otherwise; for the Extent and Fertility of the Country is so vastly
disproportionate to the Number of Inhabitants, that good Lands are in most
of the Colonies an easy Acquisition, to those that will clear them, and where
Estates may thus be raised by meer Tillage, all Temptations to
Manufactures are wanting; Men who can depend upon their Industry alone,
will not have recourse to Arts for Subsistance; and a Father, who can enable
his Son to provide for himself, by taking up a Piece of uncleared Land for
him, as soon as he is of Age to manage it, and till then has his Assistance in
cultivating that, which he himself had cleared in his Youth, will think
Money and Time both thrown away in teaching him a Business not so good
as his own, and by which it will appear to him that his Child is pre-maturely
taken out of his Family. He really can with less Expence set him up in a
Farm than in a Trade, and he knows that a Farmer who cultivates
improveable Land for his own Advantage, is in a better Situation than a
Manufacturer: It is just the Difference between a substantial Yeoman, and a

Journeyman Weaver. So long therefore as the Americans can get Land at an
easy Rate, they will apply to the Cultivation of it in preference to all other
Employments: and it is the Glory of the last Peace, that it has furnished
them with Territory sufficient to subsist their People in all their Increase to
very distant Generations. Still however it may be said all Manufactures in
the Colonies are not carried on by Foreigners only; including even those
that go from these Kingdoms, who so far may be considered as Foreigners
there: Many Natives of America it may be urged are amongst them; and it is
true; accidental Circumstances engage them, and the Necessities of the
Country require them; for there is a certain Degree of Manufacture
attendant upon Cultivation, in order to convert to its proper Use the whole
of every Production, some Parts of which might otherwise be left a
worthless Refuse on the Hands of the Planter. In the Article of Flax, for
Instance, which has hitherto been raised in America principally to supply
the Demand of Flax Seed for sowing, and other Purposes here, the Stalks
must be thrown away, if there is no Opportunity to export or to spin them.
Hitherto the Exportation has not been found to answer; and therefore the
Farmers employ their Families in spinning, when the Rigour or Inclemency
of the Season confine them within doors: This is the real Foundation of
their Linen Manufactory; They have hitherto proceeded no further than this
has carried them; nor is it likely they should soon make a greater Progress;
for even in Pensylvania, where more Flax is raised and more Weavers are
settled, than in any other Province, common Labour is so dear, that if a
Farmer cannot spin his own Flax in his own House, and by his own Family,
he will not find his Account in putting it out to be spun: if that Expence
falls upon him, he can supply himself cheaper with Linen from England: So
very small is the Advantage of Manufacturing for themselves, and so very
confined is such a Manufactory: Materials will never be purposely raised to

supply it, it cannot bear the Expence of all its several Branches, if those
employed in them are to apply themselves to no other, nor will it ever
produce such a Quantity of Merchandize, as to become an Article of
Commerce; yet limited as it is in its Nature, it will probably rather diminish
than increase, now that the Parliament has granted a Bounty as abovementioned on the Importation of Flax: The American Planter will no longer
complain that his Flax Stalks must be wasted if he does not Manufacture
them: but a Vent being opened for them into Great Britain, whither he could
not afford to send them before, this will probably be found to be the most
advantageous Manner of disposing of them.
But there are more cogent Reasons still of a public Consideration
against the Attempt to extend such a Manufactory; for tho’ the Inhabitants
of these Kingdoms and of America are equally Subjects of Great Britain,
yet they serve the State in different Capacities; and if to make
unwarrantable Distinctions between them would be Oppression; on the
other hand to preserve the Distinctions which the Difference of their
Situations has made, is true policy, which has the general Good for its
Object: Extent of Country, Fertility of Soil, Cheapness of Land, Variety of
Climate, and scarcity of Inhabitants, naturally lead the Americans to
Cultivation: There are hardly any Productions of the Earth which they
cannot raise; including the West India Islands I believe there are none: But
putting them out of the Case for the present, the Continent alone can
produce Provisions for Subsistence, Commodities for Commerce, and the
raw Materials for Manufacturers to work with, in much greater Variety, in
Quantities immeasurably larger, and on Terms by far more easy than they
could be raised in Great Britain; here on the contrary, landed Property is
very valuable, and but a small proportion of it still remains improveable to
any considerable degree, by force of Cultivation only; so that the

Occupation of Land is rather a Means of vesting than of acquiring Money.
But the Inhabitants of Great Britain are more than sufficient for its
Cultivation, and must seek for Fortunes, and even for Subsistance in Trade
and Manufactures: They have Science, Experience, and Skill, supported by
Riches and Credit equal to any undertaking, while a constant
Correspondence and easy Intercourse between themselves, and a universal
Commerce to all parts of the Globe, enables them to dispose of all they
prepare for Merchandize: In every one of these Articles so necessary to
Manufactories, they have greatly the Advantage of the Americans; and the
Basis of all, manual labour, is cheaper here than it is there, so great is their
Demand to clear the immense Tracts which still lie waste, and to improve
those which they have hitherto been able to cultivate but partially. The
Manufactures therefore of Great Britain must on all these Accounts be
superior in Quality, and lower in price than those of America. And the
necessary Consequence from the different Circumstances of the two
Countries is, that neither can encroach upon the other in the Articles that are
particularly adapted to each, without Prejudice to both: Commerce is in
many respects common to both; but Lands are wanting in the one for
Produce, and hands cannot be found for Manufactories in the other: Should
then the Americans attempt to extend their Manufactures beyond the point,
to which the convenience of the Planter, and the accidental Circumstances
of Individuals, will naturally carry them, should they endeavour to establish
them as Branches of Commerce, they would immediately raise the price of
Labour already extravagantly high; they would draw off their people from
their proper Employment in Agriculture; retard the clearing of the Country;
check all Improvements of Land; load its produce with an additional
Expence; enhance the Value of all the Necessaries of Life; and their success
in the End, if they should succeed, would be less Detrimental to their

Mother Country, than to themselves. Success however is not to be expected:
The Difficulties that will arise from the Circumstances of the Country and
the Genius of the People, both naturally adverse to Manufactures, are too
great for any Individuals to struggle with; for it will be no easy Task to
persuade the Americans to forsake the rich Lands that invite their Culture,
and promise an ample Recompence for the Labour bestowed upon them; to
leave the ways their Fathers trod, and in which themselves were trained; to
drop a Business which they already understand, in which they have had a
long Experience, and by which all their Family have thriven; in short, to
change all their Habits of thinking, and their whole Manner of Life; in order
to apply to Arts which they do not know, or know but imperfectly, with a
great loss of Time, and at an uncertain Expence, in pursuit of precarious
Gain. Yet all this must be effected before regular extensive Mercantile
Manufactories can be established in any considerable Numbers in America:
Those that subsist there now, are of a quite different Nature, arising out of
Agriculture itself, as one of its natural Effects, which instead of Checking,
encourages its Progress: That of Linens has no other foundation; and when
its Extent is fully examined, it will be found not to have passed beyond the
Bounds, which such a source would naturally supply. For it is not to be
imagined that they manufacture all they do not Import from Great Britain:
Large Quantities are annually sent thither from the Ports of Holland and
other Countries on the German Ocean, in Ships employed in an illicit Trade
with the Colonies. Others are smuggled in by smaller Parcels from the
Foreign, particularly from the Dutch Islands; and no inconsiderable
Quantity is constantly brought by the Germans who go to settle there in
great Numbers every Year; many of whom have, with them one, two, three,
or more, Pieces of Linen, which they find Means to land clandestinely, and
dispose of at moderate Prices. These Deductions being made from the

Difference between the Exportation from hence, and the Consumption in
America, the Remainder, which is all that they manufacture themselves, will
be found to be much less than is usually supposed.
The Subject is capable of a much larger Discussion than I have Room
for; but the Reasons that have been mentioned, may perhaps be sufficent,
without urging them any further, or supporting them with others that might
be given, to shew that all Attempts to establish Manufactures in America, to
an Extent that may be alarming to Great Britain, must prove abortive in the
End; at least, the additional Duty upon Linens affords no Ground for such
Apprehensions: it is but half a Subsidy that is imposed, which is too
inconsiderable upon the whole to make a material Difference: the Tax it is
true, falls unequally, as Linens of very different Prices pay the same Duty,
being comprehended under the general Denomination of Narrow Germans.
This is a Grievance that is equally felt in Great Britain, and which I hope
will be thought deserving of a Remedy: Could a Line of Distinction be
drawn between the finer and coarser Linens, that are now included within
the same Description, and such I should think it would not be impossible
for Persons engaged in that Trade to draw, I flatter myself that it would be
adopted: but in the mean while, the Americans have no greater Reason to
complain than the English of this Disproportion; and as to the actual Duty
required of them, they must still consider themselves as favoured, not
oppressed, when they reflect that upon the cheapest of these Linens, those
on which the Duty is most burthensome, the old Subsidy is but about Three
Shillings, and Nine-pence Three Farthings upon a Hundred and Twenty
Ells, which is all that they are now to pay, and half of which they paid
before; while the several Imposts paid by the English for their Consumption
upon the same Quantity of the same Linen amounts to about One Pound,
One Shilling, and Four-pence, Three Farthings, which is a greater

Disproportion of Burthen, than their different Situations and Circumstances
require.
Should there, however, be any Americans so unreasonable, so rash, as
on this Account to engage in the Establishment of Linen Manufactories
there, and supposing a Contrariety between the Interests of Great Britain
and its Colonies, affect to support the one, to the prejudice of the other; they
can still proceed in their Attempt no further than the Mother Country will
allow: I do not mean to suggest prohibitory Laws; but Laws to which no
American could form an Objection, would effectually thwart all their
Endeavours. It has been already observed, that the only Circumstance
which enables the Planter to manufacture Linens cheaper than he can buy
them when imported from hence, is because he does not pay for the
Spinning; this was the Case under the Duty of half the old Subsidy: Should
it for the Sake of Argument be supposed, (tho’ I cannot believe,) that the
additional half Subsidy will turn the Scale, and enable any Person there,
tho’ he were to pay for the Spinning of the Flax, to make Linen cheaper
than it can be bought; which is the most that can be apprehended; it will
always be in the Power of Great Britain to reinstate Things where they
were, and if the additional Duty has caused an Alteration, the taking off that
Duty must necessarily restore the imported Linens to their former Price,
which is lower than American Manufacturers can afford them for; while on
the other Hand, a Bounty upon American Flax, imported into Great Britain,
will give the British Manufacturer a still further Advantage over the
American, and enable him even to purchase his Materials cheaper. Thus by
easing the Colonies of a Tax on their Consumption, and by giving
Encouragement to their Produce, both which the Mother Country ought
upon all Occasions to do, as far as the Exigencies of State will allow, Great
Britain has it in her Power to disappoint any Establishments of this Kind

that are contrary to the general Good; and however Individuals may be
affected, the general Assemblies in their respective Provinces will never
upon mature Deliberation support the Prosecution of Designs, which have a
direct Tendency to hurt the Manufactories of the Mother Country, to check
Cultivation in the Colonies, and to lessen the Navigation of both.
The whole Objection, however, against the additional Duty on Linens,
applies to the coarser Kinds, upon which alone a Burthen in itself so
inconsiderable, can be felt at all: On the finer Kinds, even of the narrow
Germans, it is not pretended that it is too heavy; much less will there be any
Room to cavil at an Increase of Duty upon French Lawns and Cambricks,
tho’ considerably greater than on the other Linens, being instead of Half the
Old Subsidy, three Shillings per Piece, at thirteen Ells to the Piece. The
Americans will still pay but about half what used to be paid by the
Consumers in this Country, when French Cambricks and Lawns were
allowed to be worn; and the Principles upon which they have been
prohibited here, dictate some Restraint at least on the Consumption of these
Commodities in the Colonies, which in effect is laid by the Imposition of a
higher Duty upon these than upon other Linens.
The same Observations apply to the prohibited East India Goods, the
wrought Silks and the painted Callicoes; they are prohibited in order to
oblige the Company to import the Silk raw, and the Callicoes white for our
own Manufactures. The Indulgence however of wearing them is not taken
away from the Colonies, but the Act of the last Sessions lays them under the
Discouragement of a Duty of Two Shillings per Pound Weight on the
wrought Silks, and of Two Shillings and Six-pence per Piece on the painted
Callicoes. This indeed is a considerable Rise upon the half Subsidy they
paid before, which amounted to no more than Four pence Farthing per
Pound Weight on the former, and Three pence per Piece on the latter; but it

hardly yet exceeds a Third of the Duty that was charged upon them, while
their Consumption was permitted in this Country: Six Shillings per Pound
on the East India wrought Silks, and Three Shillings and Six-pence per
Piece on the painted Callicoes, together with Fifteen per Cent. on the gross
Price of the latter, did not check that Consumption so much as the Interests
of our own Manufacturers required, and made a Prohibition necessary: for
such is the Delicacy and the Beauty of these Commodities, that Persons
who pique themselves on Elegance, and can afford to gratify their Taste,
will not be detered from the Indulgence, by a much heavier Duty than is
now levied on the American Consumption. This Consideration solves the
Doubt that has been surmised, of the Operation such a Tax may have on the
Demand of the Foreign, particularly the Spanish Colonies, for East India
Manufactures: I believe it will have none, or at least no considerable Effect:
for there is not a People upon the Globe, to whose Use, to whose Manners,
and whose Dispositions, these Commodities are more particularly adapted:
No other resemble them so much, as to be easily substituted in their Room;
and the advanced Price will not raise them to a Value too extravagant for
such Purchasers; but should it be said that the Dutch will now be able to
furnish them at a cheaper Rate; the Answer is, that the Piece Goods of
India, have been long imported by our Company in larger Quantities than
by any other: that the Concessions made by France in the late Treaty of
Peace, with respect to the East India Trade and Settlements, will in this
Branch particularly give us still greater Advantages; and that the Dutch
therefore must as they actually do provide themselves with the greater Part
of their Supply at our East India Sales: Upon all that they buy there, they
pay a Commission and a Freight, from which the British Merchant is free,
and which perhaps may be an Equivalent for the Duty: If it is not, the
Remedy is obvious, it is but spreading the same Imposition or a Part of it

over all Exportation of such Goods, and then the Situations of the Dutch
and British Merchants, with Respect to each other, will again be, just what
they have been hitherto. Muslins and White Callicoes, which are not
prohibited, are rated by the Act of the last Sessions, but in a different
Manner, higher than other Linens; for instead of retaining the additional
half Subsidy, a Draw-back of Four Pounds Fifteen Shillings upon every
Hundred Pounds of their gross Price at the Sale is retain’d, upon all that are
exported to America. This is less by almost three Fourths than the Duty paid
by the Consumers of the same Commodities in Britain; yet under that
Weight the Manufacture of printing Callicoes has flourished, and we may
therefore reasonably expect that it will not be oppressed by a Burthen
comparatively so light upon printed Callicoes consumed in the Colonies;
especially when we consider that the additional Value they acquire by the
Manufacture is not taxed, those printed in England being construed to be
but White Callicoes within the Description of the Acts of Parliament that
relate to them: and other Linens which have gone thro’ the same
Manufacture, and which are now become of such general Use, both for
Apparel and Furniture, are free from the Duty on Callicoes.
The Distinction made in this Act of Parliament between the French
Lawns and Cambricks, the East India Callicoes and Muslins which are all
high-priced, and other Kinds of Linen which are in general of a lower
Value, will I hope justify me in saying, that if a Line could be drawn
between the finer and the coarser Linens, which now pass indiscriminately
under the Denomination of Narrow Germans, it would probably be adopted:
if it were, the Duty upon all Kinds of Linens would then be throughout
compleatly agreeable to the equitable Maxim of laying Taxes in different
Proportions, on the Consumption of the Rich, and on that of the Poor: that
while the Indulgencies and Refinements of the one are converted into

beneficial Branches of the Public Revenue, the other may with more
Chearfulness contribute out of their Pittance the Mite they owe, to the
Service of the State they belong to. The Inhabitants of the West Indies,
whose Opulence, whose Luxury, and I might say, whose Situation leads
them into more Extravagance in such Articles, than prevails among the
Inhabitants of the Continent, will therefore be more sensibly affected by
these Duties, in which the Value is to a certain Degree made the Measure of
the Duties; but it is right that throughout all the British Dominions, the
Necessaries of Life should be less burthened than the Superfluities, and that
all his Majesty’s Subjects, wheresoever dispersed, should contribute to the
publick Revenue, in Proportion to their Abilities, and not to their Numbers.
A Duty upon Wine comes within the same Description of a Tax upon
Luxury, but the Regulations made during the last Sessions of Parliament,
with respect to the several Sorts of Wine for the Consumption of America,
are so different, and founded upon such peculiar Circumstances, that it is
difficult to say whether in the Event it will prove, that an Imposition has
been laid or taken off from that Commodity. The Wine that has been
hitherto exported from hence to the Colonies, has been allowed no other
Draw-back than on any other Exportation. But the Colonies have always
been permitted to import Wine from the Madeiras and the Azores, without
bringing it thro’ Great Britain; the natural Consequence of the Saving
thereby made, both of Freight and of Duty, has been a Preference of these to
all others, so that these are become almost their only Consumption. The
Inhabitants of Madeira have on this Account long had a kind of Monopoly
of the Wine Trade to our Colonies, and have taken the Advantages which
Monopolists usually take, of advancing the Price and lowering the Quality;
as the Demand increases with the Population of the Colonies, the
Oppression must be the greater, and it is already such as to make it

necessary to bring the Madeira Wines nearer to a Level with others: with
this View a larger Draw-back than formerly is allowed on all but French
Wines, exported from hence to the West Indies and America; for instead of
Eleven Pounds, Thirteen Shillings and Six-pence per Ton Duty which used
to remain, but Three Pounds, Ten Shillings is from henceforth to be retained
here, Ten Shillings is imposed in the Colonies to make the respective
Custom-house Accounts, Checks upon each other. But while the Duty is
lowered on these, a new one of Seven Pounds per Ton is imposed on those
of the Madeiras, and other Places from whence Wines may be lawfully
imported into the Colonies. As a Luxury, they ought in justice, and as a
Monopoly, they ought in Policy to be taxed; but should the Effect of these
Regulations be such as may reasonably be expected, the Price of Wines in
general will rather be lowered than advanced by the Duty upon one Species
of them only. Such as are carried from hence will certainly be cheaper by
Seven Pounds, Thirteen Shillings and Six-pence per Ton, than they used to
be; they will for the most Part too be cheaper than those of the Madeiras,
their original Price, and the Duty upon them being so much less, as to overballance the Difference of Freight. The Demand and consequently the Price
of the latter will thereby be lessened: they will be no longer a Monopoly,
because no longer a Necessary, and will therefore be cheaper than they are
now; and this Tax upon a Luxury of foreign Growth, co-operating with the
Encouragement given to Exportation from hence, will have the still further
beneficial Effects of improving at the same time Navigation and Revenue.
Luxuries even of our own Growth do not escape Taxation; Coffee, the
Produce of the British Plantations, is charged with Seven Shillings the
Hundred Weight, and Pimento with an Half-penny per Pound. The Duties
indeed are light, for it is not meant to prejudice the Consumption of
Commodities, of which we must wish to encourage the Cultivation; but

only that those who can afford to indulge in such Delicacies, should
contribute something to the publick Wants, and ease from heavier Burthens
the Necessaries of the Poor: if the Tax went further, it would be pernicious,
in loading too much the valuable Produce of some of our Colonies. The
Intention of the Legislature appears to have been on the contrary, to
encourage the raising of Coffee in our West India Islands, by giving it an
Advantage over that produced in foreign Plantations, upon every Hundred
Weight of which a Duty of Two Pounds Nineteen Shillings and Nine-pence
is by the same Act imposed. So great a Difference of Duty upon a Hundred
Weight, the prime Cost of which will not exceed Three Pounds, must give a
Preference to our own Produce, which is particularly recommended to
Public Encouragement, by the Circumstances of being raised with less
Expence than Sugar, and therefore within the Reach of the first Settlers in
the ceded Islands.
The same Reason holds, and perhaps more strongly, with respect to
Indigo, which, if imported from foreign Plantations into any of our
Colonies, is by the Act so frequently refered to, charged with a Duty of Sixpence per Pound, while our own Produce passes free. Indigo is a
Commodity, which particularly attracts our Notice at this Juncture; great
Quantities of it used to be raised in our West India Islands, but for many
Years very little has been produced; and we have been in a great Measure
supplied by the French. The Reason of this has not been, (as is commonly
supposed,) the high Duties that were laid upon it, but the clearing of the
Country; for Indigo is a Plant that requires Moisture, which nothing can
secure in those torrid Climates, but the Proximity of Mountains to break the
Clouds in their Passage, or of Woods from whence Vapours are continually
exhaled, to refresh the Neighbourhood with Showers: as the Woods have
been cut away, this Resource has gradually failed, and the Produce of

Indigo, which depended upon it, has declined in Proportion. The West
Indians regret but little the Loss of a Commodity, which has made way for a
greater Cultivation of their favourite Produce, Sugar; but the Nation must
sensibly feel the Inconvenience of being furnished from other Countries,
with so valuable an Article of Commerce, and so necessary a Material of
Manufacture.
This Consideration has induced some Planters in South Carolina to
attempt to raise it there, and they have already succeeded so far as to prove,
that the Soil and the Climate agree with the Plant, and that they are
acquainted with the Art of extracting the Juice, so as to equal the finest in
Quality. The great Losses they sustained by the Captures of their Ships,
have a little retarded their Progress: but now that Peace is restored, there is
reason to expect that this Cultivation will flourish, and even be extended to
Georgia and the two Floridas, which are rather better adapted to it than
South Carolina. To make the Indigo they shall raise cheaper than any that
can be imported from the French Islands into America, will facilitate the
Attempt to recover this Commodity, and be very serviceable to those
Colonies: the ceded Islands too will have their share of the Benefit, as the
Certainty of Moisture from the Woodiness of the Country, and the
Cheapness of the Culture, will render this a very proper and a very
considerable Article of Produce to those who may purchase or settle there.
Another, and that a most important Branch, both of Commerce and of
Revenue, I mean the Produce of the Sugar Cane, in its several States of
Melasses, Rum and Sugar, has been under the Consideration of Parliament,
during the last Winter; and the Degree of Restraint put upon the French
Trade in this Article, is proportioned to the Stage of Manufacture, in which
the Commodity may be at the Time of Importation: Rum is Melasses
manufactured: The French were unacquainted with the Art, or at least, did

not give into the Practice of making Rum, till taught and led to it by our
People, while we were in Possession of their Islands: At that Time some
Distilleries were set up for this Purpose, which are said to be continued
since the Peace; but they can never be of any consequence, if we do not
help the Persons concerned in them to dispose of what they produce.
France will not permit her Colonies to establish a Manufacture that shall
interfere with any Branch of her own, and will therefore prevent the making
of Rum, so far as it affects the Consumption of her Brandy. There can for
this Reason be very little Vent for it, unless by Exportation to our Colonies
on the Continent: but hitherto those very Colonies have had the
manufacturing of the French Melasses; and to permit them now to be
brought in any other Shape than as a raw Material, would be very
detrimental to the North America Distillery: A strict Prohibition is therefore
laid on all Rum or Spirits of the Produce or Manufacture of any of the
Colonies or Plantations in America not in the Possession or under the
Dominion of his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, in order to force the
French to supply the Demands of our Colonies for their Melasses, tho’ they
can make it into Rum themselves, and tho’ the Trade should undergo some
Alteration by new Duties and new Regulations.
That Trade was indeed in a Situation that required some Alteration. By
6 Geo. II. c. 13. a Duty of Six-pence per Gallon was laid upon all foreign
Melasses; but such has been the Disregard of all Revenue Laws in America,
that this has produced hardly any Thing, tho’ the Commodity has been
imported all the time in great Quantities. Instead of paying the Duty, a
regular Course has been fallen into of importing it free of any; and the
Expence of such Smuggling has been brought to a Certainty of about Three
Half-pence a Gallon; which was a Charge upon the raw Materials before it
came to the Manufacturer, amounting to one Fourth of the Duty, and

destructive of the whole: under this Charge the Distilleries of North
America have flourished to a surprizing Degree; and surely it is to be
wished that the Burthen now upon the Merchandize, should yield a
Revenue to the Publick instead of a Profit to Smugglers, or which is worse,
to Officers of the Crown conniving at Smugglers: but it has been said that
the excessive high Duty, imposed by the 6 Geo. II. was the Cause of the
Smuggling, and that nothing will put a Stop to it but reducing the Tax. The
Fact is probable; the Legislature seem to have thought that the Load was
heavier than the Trade could bear; and have therefore reduced it from Sixpence to Three-pence per Gallon: this still is represented by some as too
high; and indeed whatever Rate is fixed, will in all Probability be censured
by those whom it affects; but so far is certain, that a Duty may always
exceed the Expence of Smuggling; for no Man will expose his Character to
Reflection, and his Property to Hazards, without the Temptation of
Advantages over the fair Trader. And as Three Half-pence per Gallon was
the Expence of Smuggling, while a general Relaxation of the Laws against
it prevailed over all that Continent, now that these Laws are rigorously put
into Execution, that Charge will be higher in Proportion to the additional
Risque of Seizures; and at the same time the Temptation is less by the
Difference between Three-pence and Six-pence. These Reasons concur to
prove that a Duty considerably higher than Three Half-pence per Gallon
may be imposed upon Melasses, without being, by its Excess, an
Inducement to Smuggling. The next Question is, what the Trade can bear
without being oppressed by it: It certainly can bear more now it is
established, than it could in its Beginnings; it has thriven, it has increased, it
continues to increase, under a Charge of Three Half-pence per Gallon; and
as Experience has shewn that it can support such a Burthen, with Ease, the
Presumption is from thence alone very strong, that it is equal to a greater

without Inconvenience. The additional Charge upon the Commodity, by the
Duty of Three-pence, is but Three Half-pence, so much only being the
Difference between the former and the present Price of Importation: and as
a Gallon of Melasses produces a Gallon of Rum, an Addition of Three Halfpence does not appear to us a severe Tax upon a Gallon of Rum. The
cheapest Spirits that are drawn in England, pay a Duty of One Shilling and
Five-pence Half-penny per Gallon to the Publick; and to expect that our
fellow Subjects should contribute Three-pence per Gallon for their
Consumption of the same Commodity, is surely not very unreasonable; so
much therefore of the Produce of their Distilleries as is necessary for
supplying the Colonies themselves, is certainly not taxed beyond what it
ought to be. But it is alledged that the Fishery, the Guinea, and the Indian
Trade cannot support the consequential Rise upon Spirituous Liquors, and
that both the Distilleries and these Branches of Commerce will sink under
the Burthen together. The Demand for the Fisheries is not to furnish the
American Ships only, but to supply those also that are sent for the Purposes
of fishing from Great Britain, and do not carry out with them sufficient
Store of Spirituous Liquors. Whatever Quantity the latter take from the
American is a Loss to the British Distilleries; and if the Effect of this Duty
should be to diminish that Quantity, I cannot see any great national
Mischief that would attend it, because I cannot admit that any Manufactures
should be encouraged in the Colonies, to the Prejudice of those established
in the Mother Country. As to the Rum used on board the American Ships,
that is a Kind of home Consumption; the Duty is but an inconsiderable
Addition to the whole Expence of the Trade, and is certainly not too much
for it to bear, as the same Trade carried on by Ships from hence, which take
in sufficient Store here, does in this Article actually bear a greater; surely
the Americans have Advantages enough by their Situation with respect to

the Fisheries, not to make it necessary to give their Manufactures the
Preference to our own, in order to enable them to fish on Terms still so
much better. As to the Trade upon the Coast of Guinea, that is no longer a
Matter of Speculation: the Experiment has been made already of advancing
the Price of American Rum there, and has succeeded. Their Rum used to be
cheaper tho’ but a little cheaper than the British Spirits on the Coast, but
was always greatly prefered by the Natives, not on Account of the
Difference of Price, but of its more fiery Quality, which made it more
acceptable to the Negroes. The British Spirits are sold on the Coast of
Guinea at about One Shilling and Two-pence Half-penny per Gallon; the
American used to be sold at about One Shilling and Two-pence: but on the
Alarm, occasioned last Year by the Establishment of Cutters, to enforce the
Collection of the Six-penny Duty, which then subsisted, the American
Merchants suddenly raised their Price from One Shilling and Two-pence to
One Shilling and Six-pence per Gallon, and yet preserved the Preference
given by the Negroes to their Spirits. The Rise was made on the
Presumption that thc Six-penny Duty would be levied; at that Time the
Reduction to Three-pence was not foreseen, for they never would have
required Four-pence of the Consumers to enable them to defray an
additional Expence of Three Half-pence only upon the Commodity: they
may now lower it again; and fixing the Price of their Rum on the Coast of
Guinea at Two Shillings and Three-pence Half-penny per Gallon, the
Profits of the Merchant will be the same as when he sold for Two Shillings
and Two pence; and he may depend on the Preference being given to the
American Spirits, since it was given when they were at Two Shillings and
Six-pence and the British at Two Shillings and Two-pence Half-penny per
Gallon. As to the Indian Trade the Americans have it much more to
themselves; there they have no Competitors to apprehend; and the poor

Savages are not, I doubt, used to such nice Calculations in their
Transactions with us, as to be very sensible to a Difference of Three Halfpence on a Gallon of Rum. I wish they had always been dealt with as fairly
as a Rise upon the Commodity will be on the present Occasion; and I
should rejoice could I be sure, that they will never have better Grounds to
complain of their Traffic with the English. Upon examining therefore the
several Places of Vent for the Spirituous Liquors made in America, there
does not seem much Reason to fear any great Detriment to the Distilleries
there from this Duty. Something more than mere Apprehensions and
general Assertions are necessary to condemn a Tax which appears so proper
on so many Accounts; and, unless Experience should prove that it is
attended with bad Consequences, or stronger Objections can be made to it
than have come to my Knowledge, I cannot join in foreboding Evils that I
do not foresee; and which, at the worst, amount to no more than that the
Colonies will not be able to manufacture a Material which they purchase of
the French, upon better Terms than the Inhabitants of Great Britain can
manufacture British Produce. The Colonies may follow the Example of
their Mother Country, and distil Spirits from their own Corn. This will be a
Consumption of that Commodity in Compensation of the Loss, which it is
said they will sustain in the Vent of it to the French Islands. But will they
lose that or any other Article of Commerce by this Burthen on the Return
they receive for them? Are not the Demands of the French for Necessaries?
Can they now, that they have ceded all North America, can they now, tho’
they could not before, supply themselves from any other than from our
Colonies, with Provisions and with Lumber? Had they no Returns to make,
must not they purchase these Necessaries with Money? and can they refuse
to make this the Return, as far as it will go, upon our own Terms, since they
have no other way to dispose of it? The Trade of the West India Islands,

whoever they belong to, is always under the Controul of the Nation that is
in Possession of North America; they depend upon that Continent for the
Subsistance of their Inhabitants, and for the Means of disposing of their
Produce, as they can no where else procure in any Quantity, or at any
tolerable Price, the Casks and other Materials that are necessary for that
Purpose. We may reject their Melasses; but they cannot refuse our
Provisions and our Lumber; and now that the whole Continent, which
produces those Articles, is ceded to Great-Britain, the French Islands are
far more dependant than they were upon her, for their Support and for their
Commerce; there is a greater Balance of Trade against them; a larger
Proportion of the Profits they make upon their Produce, must be expended
in the Purchase of those Necessaries, which North America alone can
supply; and they are on these and many other Accounts, far less valuable to
France than they were while she retained her Colonies on the Continent.
They will sink still lower in their Value, when the Demands of North
America shall decrease, as the ceded Islands improve; for the French
Plantations have hitherto produced Coffee, Cotton, Cocoa, Ginger, Indigo,
and Pimento, in greater Quantities than ours: because their Planters are
poorer, and their Lands in a lower State of Cultivation. These Articles,
exclusive of such of them as may be raised in the Floridas, will for the
same Reasons be most attended to, by the first Settlers on the ceded Islands;
and as soon as they attain to the raising of Sugar, they will again interfere
with the French in the great Article of Melasses; as it is well known that the
Cane yields much larger Quantities of Melasses when planted on fresh
Lands; and that the Reason why our Islands do not produce so much as the
French, is only because the Lands are more exhausted in our than in their
Plantations. The Sugar itself, which these Islands will produce, will be a
further Diminution of the Demands of our Colonies upon those of the

French; and the less those Demands are, so much the more must their
Plantations be at our Mercy, in such Articles as we may still have Occasion
for from them; while their Want of what we alone can furnish, can never
diminish, unless their Colonies decline. The Duty of One Pound Two
Shillings on all foreign white or clay’d Sugars, imported into the British
Colonies, which is imposed by the Act of the last Sessions, cannot be
complained of by the Americans, so far as their own Consumption is
affected by it, since the Inhabitants of Great Britain have chearfully
submitted their Consumption to the like Regulation, and for the Benefit of
the West India Plantations, have laid a much higher Duty upon French than
upon British Sugars imported into Great Britain: but it is objected to this
Tax, that it will hurt the Trade of the North Americans, as Carriers of the
French Sugars to Europe; a Trade profitable in itself, and promoting
Navigation; on which Accounts it is said, a Drawback of great Part or of the
whole of the Duty, should be allowed on Re-exportation. Could this be done
without opening Opportunities for the greatest Frauds on the Revenue, it
might be proper; but it is well known that no Indulgence to Trade is so
much abused to the prejudice, both of the Revenue and of Commerce, as the
Allowance of Drawbacks here; and it will be liable to greater Abuses in
America, unless some more effectual Method than has hitherto been
practised, could be found to prevent them: and after all it remains to be
proved, that the Object is great enough to justify the dangerous Experiment
of making in any Shape an Allowance of a Drawback; the North Americans
had indeed formerly the Carriage of the French Sugars to a considerable
Amount; but the French have for many Years carried the greater Part
themselves. This Duty too, it must be observed, is only on the White and
the Clay’d, that is, the manufactured Sugars: the Effect of it may be in some
Degree, to induce the French to send their Sugars in a lower State of

Manufacture to North America, and then they will be free of Duty: the
Carriage of these is not affected: as to the Carriage of the others, if what is
left of that Trade could be retained without exposing the Revenue and the
fair Trader to Losses, they ought to be free from, it certainly would be
proper to do it; the only Doubt is whether it be possible.
These are the several Duties imposed by Parliament during the last
Sessions, upon the Consumption of America; and they appear to have been
judiciously chosen, not only with a View to the Revenue, which they will
produce; but for other, and in my Opinion, greater political Purposes, which
each of them will respectively answer; and besides those already
mentioned, there is one general Effect that will result from the whole, which
will be of the utmost Importance to the Trade of Great Britain, and to the
Connection between her and her Colonies; tho’ the Duties are very low, the
Articles on which they are laid are numerous, and comprehend all that have
been the Subjects of a contraband Trade, with those Parts of Europe which
the Colonies are not allowed to trade to. The bringing these to a regular
Entry and Account, will be the Means of detecting and of preventing the
illicit Proceedings that have hitherto prevailed; and not only support and
encourage the British Manufactures, but maintain and improve the
Commerce and Navigation, both of Great Britain and her Colonies, tho’ the
Merchandize should be the Produce of neither. In other Countries Customhouse Duties are for the most Part, little more than a Branch of the
Revenue: In the Colonies they are a political Regulation, and enforce the
Observance of those wise Laws to which the great Increase of our Trade
and naval Power are principally owing. The Aim of those Laws is to
confine the European Commerce of the Colonies to the Mother Country: to
provide that their most valuable Commodities shall be exported either to
Great Britain or to British Plantations; and to secure the Navigation of all

American Exports and Imports to British Ships and British Subjects only. It
is the Policy of every Nation to prohibit all foreign Trade with their
Plantations: it has been the Policy of this almost as far back as we have had
any Colonies worth regarding; the first and great Act of Navigation being
nearly co-æval with their Existence as a People; before that Time the
English of the West-Indies were but Adventurers, and the Inhabitants of
North America were but a few unhappy Fugitives, who had wandered
thither to enjoy their civil and religious Liberties, which they were deprived
of at home. The Distractions of this Country had indeed increased their
Numbers, but they were still separate, weak, necessitous, and truly infant
Colonies, nursed by perpetual Supplies from the Mother Country, exposed
to every Hazard, sustained with Difficulty, and only beginning to give
hopes that they might hereafter be what they now are. Upon this Prospect
the Act of Navigation form’d their Dependance into Connection, and gave a
Sanction to the Emigration and the Expence occasioned by supporting
them; for Colonies are only Settlements made in distant Parts of the World,
for the Improvement of Trade; but if they were allowed to transfer the
Benefits of their Commerce to any other Country than that from which they
came, they would destroy the very Purposes of their Establishment: and it is
but an equitable Return for the Accommodation which has been provided
for them, and the Emoluments they have received, that they, the Subjects
still of the same Country, should continue to act as they must have acted,
had they continued its Inhabitants, and that their Produce and their
Consumption should be for the Benefit of that Country, in Preference to any
other. No Nation would tolerate Colonies upon any other Conditions: It
would be suffering themselves to be exhausted, impoverished, and
weakened, in support of a People, who might divert their Commerce to the
Advantage of another, perhaps of a Rival, and the Mother Country would be

ruined by the Prosperity of her Colonies. The Act of Navigation therefore is
founded upon Right as well as Policy; the Principles of it have been adopted
and confirmed in all our subsequent Laws; the Injunctions it contains have
never been departed from, without very cogent Reasons, and then only in a
few particular Instances. The Effects of it have been the Increase of our
Trade and Navigation; and all Evasions therefore of this, and the other Acts
of Trade and Navigation, are destructive of what every Subject of these
Kingdoms should pay the utmost Attention to; for tho’ Individuals may gain
a Profit, tho’ Consumers may procure at a cheaper Rate the Commodities
they want, by the Breach of these Laws, yet the Interests, I do not mean the
Revenue only, but the essential Interests of the Commonweal are thereby
sacrificed to private, partial, and trifling Emoluments, uncertain in their
Nature, temporary in Duration, and ruinous in the End. Even the Colonies
themselves suffer from the Advantages made by some of their Inhabitants;
not only in the Distress these iniquitous Practices bring upon their fair
Traders; in the Loss of Employment to their Shipping; and in the Perversion
of the Industry, and the Depravation of the Morals of so many of their
People; but most materially in depriving their Mother Country (so far as
such Practices extend) of those Resources, which the Commerce of her
Colonies secured to herself would constantly furnish, for their Benefit and
her own; when her Trade and her Manufactures by these Means decline, her
people decrease, and her Power and her Revenues diminish; her Efforts
must be so much the fainter for general or partial Good, her Ability to raise
within herself the Supplies which the Support, the Defence, and the
Improvement of her vast Empire require, is so far less; and her Demands for
Assistance must consequently be greater upon her Colonies, who can
answer those Demands only by oppressing their fair Traders and their
honest Consumers. It might not perhaps be difficult to shew that Smuggling

has not lower’d the Price upon the whole Consumption of America taken
together, tho’ particular Articles may in some Places and to some Persons
have come cheaper. The Effects it has had upon others, that are not so
particularly the Object of it, and the general Effects of it upon all Markets,
more than counterbalance this Advantage; but these are too many and too
great to be discussed at present. It may be sufficient here, just to suggest the
Proposition to those who are inclined to examine it, and to support it only
with observing, that the salutary Provisions of the Acts of Trade and
Navigation, are acknowledged by the most reputable and the most
considerate Inhabitants of the Colonies, and that they constantly deplore the
little Regard that has been paid to them by their self-interested and
inadvertent Countrymen. To them therefore, and to every true Lover of his
Country, whatever Part of the British Dominions he inhabits, the Act of the
last Sessions of Parliament, which, by its general Tendency and particular
Provisions, must greatly corroborate those Laws, will be a most welcome
Regulation of Commerce. The contraband Trade that is carried on there, is a
Subject of the most serious Consideration; and is become a much more
alarming Circumstance, than that Increase of Wealth, People, and Territory,
which raises Apprehensions in many Persons that the Colonies may break
off their Connections with Great Britain: That Connection is actually
broken already, wherever the Acts of Navigation are disregarded; and for so
much of their Trade as is thereby diverted from its proper Channel, they are
no longer British Colonies, but Colonies of the Countries they trade to.
Thither they carry their Produce; from thence they receive their Supply; and
Trade and Navigation flourish there, by an illicit Intercourse with the
British Plantations. The Extent of this Commerce, as it is in its Nature
private, cannot be certainly known; but that it is now carried to a dangerous
Excess, is an indisputable Fact. Ships are continually passing between our

Plantations and Holland, Hamburg, and most of the Ports on the German
Ocean, and in the Baltic, all direct Communication, with which, exclusive
of the Intervention of Great Britain, is illegal. At other Places, which the
Ships of the Plantations are allowed to resort to without touching here, for
particular Purposes, the Licence is abused, and Commodities not permitted
to be sent to our Colonies, but thro’ this Country, are immediately carried
from thence; and great Quantities of European Commodities are besides
constantly smuggled from foreign Plantations into ours. The Concurrence
of all these several Modes of evading the Acts of Navigation, can alone
account for the Demands of the Colonies upon their Mother Country, being
vastly disproportioned to their Consumption. The Half Subsidy retained
here upon the finer Linens amounts to no more than about 300l. per Ann.
and yet no one will venture to represent the Linen Manufactory of North
America to be in so flourishing a State, as to produce all that the Inhabitants
use above that small Quantity. The whole annual Export of Wine from
hence to the Plantations, falls greatly short of an Hundred Ton; can the
Madeira and the Western Islands furnish the Rest of their Consumption?
The Tea that is sent from hence does not generally exceed One Hundred and
Fifty Thousand Pounds weight per Ann. tho’ by the best Computation that
can be made, the Colonies must consume One Million Five Hundred
Thousand Pounds Weight in the Year. The Dutch, the French, the Swedish,
the Danish, East India Companies, supply them with nine tenths of their
Consumption, to the Prejudice of the English Company, of their Trade and
their Navigation. Many other Facts, supported by the concurrent Testimony
of all who have ever resided in the Plantations, might be adduced to prove,
the great Extent of their illicit Commerce in European Commodities,
(including those which must be conveyed thro’ Europe to them,) and justify
the common Calculation that the foreign Goods illegally run into the

Colonies amount in value to no less than 700000l. per Annum, which
exceeds by far the Value of those foreign Goods that are conveyed thither
thro’ Great Britain.
The Suppression of so enormous and so dangerous an Evil, is a great
Object of State, which has been long, far too long neglected: the Laws that
have been made for preventing it, were sunk into Disuse, and the due
Execution of them is become obnoxious to those who have been suffered to
contemn them with Impunity. That Licentiousness however is now at an
End; the Reform that was necessary, has I hear been made among the
Officers of the Crown. The Civil, the Military, the naval Powers, appear to
have been all exerted, for the same salutary Purposes; and the Legislative
Authority has in the great Act, that has been so often mentioned, added
Vigour and Effect to the former Laws of Trade and Navigation: the
particular Clauses that belong to the immediate Subjects of this Act only,
demand the Attention of those who are concerned in the Branches of Trade,
which they respectively regulate; but are too numerous and too minute to be
enlarged upon at present. It is sufficient to observe, that they are all
conducive to the same End with those more general Provisions, which on
Account of their extensive Importance, are universally interesting.
The Policy of prohibiting certain enumerated Goods, from being
exported out of the Plantations, except to some other British Plantation, or
to Great Britain, was introduced by the first Act of Trade and Navigation,
and has been adopted in many subsequent Statutes. The enumerated
Commodities were those which appeared at that Time the most important to
secure to British Traders only; but the great Improvements of the Colonies
having produced others equally valuable, and the late Accessions of
Territory having given us the Monopoly of some, which we have hitherto
only shared with the French, the Restraint is upon the same Principles of

Policy extended to these also, and Coffee, Pimento, Cocoa Nuts, Whale
Fins, Raw Silk, Hides and Skins, Pot and Pearl Ashes, are by the Act of the
last Sessions added to the enumerated Commodities, because they are
necessary for our own Consumption or Manufactures; Iron and Lumber,
tho’ of equal Utility, yet being a great Article of Trade, in foreign
Plantations, are allowed to be disposed of there; but are not to be carried to
any other Part of Europe, except to Great Britain.
A Bond has been always required for every Vessel loading enumerated
Goods, by which the Parties concerned obliged themselves to comply with
the Laws that relate to them; but when non-enumerated Goods only have
been shipped, no Security has ever been taken for the proper Disposal of the
Returns usually made from the foreign Plantations; and great Quantities of
foreign Melasses and Syrups have been clandestinely run into the Colonies,
the Importers of which would have been detered from attempting to
smuggle, if they had been liable to the Penalties of their Bonds upon
Detection. A Bond therefore is by this Act required on the loading of nonenumerated Goods also, with Condition, that if any foreign Melasses or
Syrups shall be taken on board in Return, the same shall be brought to
Great Britain, or to a British Plantation, and the Master of the Vessel shall,
on his Arrival, make a true Report of his Cargo.
But whether Bond had been given in either of these Cases, or what
were the Conditions of it, could not be known at any other Place than the
Port from whence the Vessel departed, if the Master of such Vessel were not
obliged to take out a Certificate of his having complied with the Law which
requires such Security: that Precaution therefore is added with respect both
to enumerated and non-enumerated Goods; and it is enforced by making all
Vessels liable to Seisure, who shall enter into any British Port, or be found

within two Leagues of the Shores of the Colonies, without such a
Certificate.
And for the further Prevention of the Smuggling of foreign Rum,
Sugars, and Melasses, which are great Objects of clandestine Trade, it is
provided, that whenever any of those Commodities are shipped, as the
Growth of a British Plantation, it shall be proved upon Oath that they are
so; and a Certificate of such Oath having been taken, shall be given to the
Master of the Vessel, who must produce it at the Port of Delivery, or the
Goods will be liable to Seizure.
All these Provisions are however but Guards against clandestine
Importations: the Goods would be to a Degree in Safety as soon as they
were landed, and might be carried out again along the neighbouring Coasts
with Security, if the Vigilance of the Law stopped here. The Danger
therefore of an illicit Commerce is continued beyond the first Importation,
and the Vent of smuggled Goods is laid under still further Difficulties and
Discouragements; for no Merchandize whatever can now be conveyed by
Sea from one Colony to another, without a Sufferance, upon which a
Cocket is to be made out, particularly specifying the Goods, and the Duties
that have been paid thereon, if they are liable to any; and every coasting
Vessel not furnished with such a Cocket, may be seized on her Arrival at the
Port of her Destination, or if she is met by a Cruizer, within two Leagues of
the Shore of any of the Colonies.
These several additional Precautions will certainly contribute very
much to the Suppression of that illicit Trade which is carried on by British
Ships and British Subjects; but they do not apply to foreign Vessels, which
being already prohibited from entering the Ports of the Colonies, only
approach the Coasts, and watch their Opportunities to land their contraband
Cargoes. For the Prevention of this Practice, the Provisions of the British

hovering Acts are extended to America, and every foreign Vessel, which
shall be found at anchor or hovering within two Leagues of the Shores of
any of the Plantations, and shall not depart or proceed on her Voyage to
some foreign Port within Forty-eight Hours after Requisition made to
depart by a Custom-house Officer, is ordered to be seized, and condemned,
whether Bulk shall have been broken or not, the French Ships employed in
the Newfoundland Fishery, within the Limits prescribed to them, only
excepted.
But that the necessary Exception, in their Favour, may not be abused,
and that the Islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, which were granted to the
French, as a bare Shelter for their Fishermen, and which are in themselves,
from their Barrenness and the Smallness of their Extent, fit for that Purpose
alone, may not be made Warehouses for supplying the British Colonies with
French Merchandize, to the Prejudice of our Manufactures and Navigation,
and the Encouragement of their Fisheries; a vigorous Clause subjects to
Forfeiture every British Vessel concerned in any Trade whatsoever with
these Islands, or hovering on their Coasts, or discovered to have been there.
The Attention of the Legislature has not however been confined to
America: Frauds practised in Britain with a View to a clandestine Trade in
the Colonies, have fallen under their Notice; and to prevent them it has been
found necessary to regulate the Trade from hence to the Colonies. It has
been a common Practice for British Ships provided with a Cargo in foreign
Countries, which was pretended to be destined for a foreign Plantation, just
to touch at some Out-port of this Kingdom, and there to take small Parcels
of Goods on board, which they entered for a British Colony: Under cover of
these, however inconsiderable, they gained Admittance into the American
Ports, and there Opportunities were not wanting to run the whole Cargoes
on shore: This pernicious Contrivance to evade the Law is now defeated, as

no Ship can from henceforth be cleared out from any British for any
American Port, unless her whole Cargo be laden here; and all Goods which
shall be found on board, and which are not expressly described in the
Cocket which the Master is obliged to take, are liable to be seized.
The Power of seizing Ships within certain Distances of the Shore
(which as has been seen) is given by this Act in so many Instances, will
make the Sea Guard of Cruizers and Cutters which was established before,
and has been of singular Use already, still more effectual; To keep up a
Body of Seamen fit for Service, and not to keep them in Service, is
impracticable: They will not be Seamen long, if active Business is not
found for them; and the employing therefore part of that Number which
Parliament has thought proper should be maintain’d during the Peace, in the
Prevention of Smuggling both here and in the Colonies, conduces at the
same time to the great Purpose of supporting a naval Power, to the
Improvement of the Revenue, and to the Regulation of Commerce. The
Officers and the Men who are engaged in this Duty are encouraged to
perform it with Spirit and Alacrity by the Prizes they may expect; and the
Check that has hitherto slackened their Vigilance, arising from the
Difficulties that attended Prosecutions, and the Uncertainty of the Shares
they would entitle themselves to, which were so varied in different Acts of
Parliament, that it was become a Science to understand them, is removed by
the Act of the last Sessions: The same Forms of Proceedings being now
established for all Prosecutions, and one certain Division being now made
of all Seizures. The Custom-house Officers share the Benefits of this
Amendment of the Law, and of the several other Facilities given to them in
the Execution of their respective Offices; while on the other hand the
Performance of their Duty is enforced by additional Penalties on the Breach
of it.

These general Regulations and the particular Provisions of the Act in
many Instances that required such special Clauses, concurring with the
vigorous Measures taken by Government to inforce Obedience to all the
Laws; and with the zealous Exertion of the civil, the military, and the naval
Powers in the Colonies, as permitted encouraged, or required by Law to
assist in the Prevention of Smuggling, give reasonable Ground to hope that
that important Object of Policy, of Commerce, and of Revenue, the
Suppression of the contraband Trade which has prevailed such a length of
time in the Colonies, will in a great measure be attained. As to the Revenue
which the new Impositions will produce, I suppose it is very difficult, if not
impossible to form any Calculation of its Amount: I will not even hazard a
Conjecture upon it, as I cannot presume that I should be right; and I should
be sorry to be wrong. Thus far however may be safely affirmed, that Duties
so low, and now first laid, will not at present contribute largely to the
Exigencies of the Public; for inconsiderable as they are, the Payment of
them will be often avoided by Frauds and Subtilties, which no Penetration
can foresee, and Experience only can discover and prevent. On the other
hand, they will be an improving Revenue; because they are laid upon
numerous Articles of general Consumption among an encreasing People;
and if not productive of a great Fund immediately, will be at least a wide
Foundation for a considerable future Revenue; but upon no Calculation can
it be supposed to be equal to the Demand that must be made upon the
Colonies; and therefore a further Tax has been proposed; it has been even
resolved by a Vote of the House of Commons, that it may be proper to
charge certain Stamp Duties in the Plantations; and here the Legislature
stoped last Sessions out of Tenderness to the Colonies. A Stamp Duty, tho’
often used in the Plantations for the Purposes of their own Government, has
never been imposed there by Authority of Parliament, and time has been

therefore very properly allowed, to enquire whether it will be attended with
any Inconveniences, and to provide Expedients of Prevention or Remedy;
but I believe the more it is examined, so much the more clearly will it
appear, that this Mode of Taxation is the easiest, the most equal and the
most certain that can be chosen: The Duty falls chiefly upon Property; but it
is spread lightly over a great Variety of Subjects, and lies heavy upon none:
The Act executes itself by annulling the Instruments that have not paid the
small Sums they are charged with; and the Tax thus supported and secured,
is collected by few Officers, without Expence to the Crown, or Oppression
on the People.
The Revenue that may be raised by the Duties which have been
already, or by these if they should be hereafter imposed, are all equally
applied by Parliament, towards defraying the necessary Expences of
defending, protecting, and securing, the British Colonies and Plantations in
America: Not that on the one hand an American Revenue might not have
been applied to different Purposes; or on the other, that Great Britain is to
contribute nothing to these: The very Words of the Act of Parliament and of
the Resolution of the House of Commons imply, that the whole of the
Expence is not to be charged upon the Colonies: They are under no
Obligation to provide for this or any other particular national Expence;
neither can they claim any Exemption from general Burthens; but being a
part of the British Dominions, are to share all necessary Services with the
rest. This in America does indeed first claim their Attention: They are
immediately, they are principally concerned in it; and the Inhabitants of
their Mother-Country would justly and loudly complain, if after all their
Efforts for the Benefit of the Colonies, when every Point is gained, and
every wish accomplished, they, and they alone should be called upon still to
answer every additional Demand, that the Preservation of these Advantages,

and the Protection of the Colonies from future Dangers, may occasion:
Great Britain has a Right at all Times, she is under a Necessity, upon this
Occasion, to demand their Assistance; but still she requires it in the Manner
most suitable to their Circumstances; for by appropriating this Revenue
towards the Defence and Security of the Provinces where it is raised, the
Produce of it is kept in the Country, the People are not deprived of the
Circulation of what Cash they have amongst themselves, and thereby the
severest Oppression of an American Tax, that of draining the Plantations of
Money which they can so ill spare, is avoided. What Part they ought to bear
of the national Expence, that is necessary for their Protection, must depend
upon their Ability, which is not yet sufficiently known: to the whole they
are certainly unequal, that would include all the military and all the naval
Establishment, all Fortifications which it may be thought proper to erect,
the Ordnance and Stores that must be furnished, and the Provisions which it
is necessary to supply; but surely a Part of this great Disbursement, a large
Proportion at least of some particular Branches of it, cannot be an
intolerable Burthen upon such a Number of Subjects, upon a Territory so
extensive, and upon the Wealth which they collectively possess. As to the
Quota which each Individual must pay, it will be difficult to persuade the
Inhabitants of this Country, where the neediest Cottager pays out of his
Pittance, however scanty, and how hardly soever earned, our high Duties of
Customs and Excise in the Price of all his Consumption; it will be difficult I
say, to persuade those who see, who suffer, or who relieve such Oppression;
that the West Indian out of his Opulence, and the North American out of his
Competency, can contribute no more than it is now pretended they can
afford towards the Expence of Services, the Benefit of which, as a Part of
this Nation they share, and as Colonists they peculiarly enjoy. They have
indeed their own civil Governments besides to support; but Great Britain

has her civil Government too; she has also a large Peace Establishment to
maintain; and the national Debt, tho’ so great a Part, and that the heaviest
Part of it has been incurred by a War undertaken for the Protection of the
Colonies, lies solely still upon her.
The Reasonableness, and even the Necessity of requiring an American
Revenue being admitted, the Right of the Mother Country to impose such a
Duty upon her Colonies, if duly considered, cannot be questioned: they
claim it is true the Privilege, which is common to all British Subjects, of
being taxed only with their own Consent, given by their Representatives;
and may they ever enjoy the Privilege in all its Extent: May this sacred
Pledge of Liberty be preserved inviolate, to the utmost Verge of our
Dominions, and to the latest Page of our History! but let us not limit the
legislative Rights of the British People to Subjects of Taxation only: No
new Law whatever can bind us that is made without the Concurrence of our
Representatives. The Acts of Trade and Navigation, and all other Acts that
relate either to ourselves or to the Colonies, are founded upon no other
Authority; they are not obligatory if a Stamp Act is not, and every
Argument in support of an Exemption from the Superintendance of the
British Parliament in the one Case, is equally applicable to the others. The
Constitution knows no Distinction; the Colonies have never attempted to
make one; but have acquiesced under several parliamentary Taxes. The 6
Geo. II. c. 13. which has been already refered to, lays heavy Duties on all
foreign Rum, Sugar, and Melasses, imported into the British Plantations:
the Amount of the Impositions has been complained of; the Policy of the
Laws has been objected to; but the Right of making such a Law, has never
been questioned. These however, it may be said, are Duties upon Imports
only, and there some imaginary Line has been supposed to be drawn; but
had it ever existed, it was passed long before, for by 25 Charles II. c. 7.

enforced by 7 and 8 Wil. and Mary, c. 22. and by 1 Geo. I. c. 12. the
Exports of the West Indian Islands, not the Merchandize purchased by the
Inhabitants, nor the Profits they might make by their Trade, but the Property
they had at the Time, the Produce of their Lands, was taxed, by the Duties
then imposed upon Sugar, Tobacco, Cotton, Indigo, Ginger, Logwood,
Fustick, and Cocoa, exported from one British Plantation to another.
It is in vain to call these only Regulations of Trade; the Trade of
British Subjects may not be regulated by such Means, without the
Concurrence of their Representatives. Duties laid for these Purposes, as
well as for the Purposes of Revenue, are still Levies of Money upon the
People. The Constitution again knows no Distinction between Impost
Duties and internal Taxation; and if some speculative Difference should be
attempted to be made, it certainly is contradicted by Fact; for an internal
Tax also was laid on the Colonies by the Establishment of a Post Office
there; which, however it may be represented, will, upon a Perusal of 9 Anne
c. 10. appear to be essentially a Tax, and that of the most authoritative Kind;
for it is enforced by Provisions, more peculiarly prohibitory and
compulsive, than others are usually attended with: The Conveyance of
Letters thro’ any other Channel is forbidden, by which Restrictions, the
Advantage which might be made by public Carriers and others of this
Branch of their Business is taken away; and the Passage of Ferries is
declared to be free for the Post, the Ferrymen being compellable
immediately on Demand to give their Labour without pay, and the
Proprietors being obliged to furnish the Means of Passage to the Post
without Recompence. These Provisions are indeed very proper, and even
necessary; but certainly Money levied by such Methods, the Effect of which
is intended to be a Monopoly of the Carriage of Letters to the Officers of
this Revenue, and by Means of which the People are forced to pay the Rates

imposed upon all their Correspondence, is a public Tax to which they must
submit, and not meerly a Price required of them for a private
Accommodation. The Act treats this and the British Postage upon exactly
the same Footing, and expresly calls them both a Revenue. The Preamble of
it declares, that the new Rates are fixed in the Manner therein specified with
a View to enable her Majesty in some Measure to carry on and finish the
War. The Sum of 700l. per Week out of all the Duties arising from time to
time by virtue of this Act is appropriated for that Purpose, and for other
necessary Occasions; the Surplus after other Deductions, was made part of
the civil List Revenues; it continued to be thus applied during the Reigns of
George I. and George II. and on his present Majesty’s Accession to the
Throne, when the Civil List was put upon a different Establishment, the
Post Office Revenues were carried with the others to the aggregate Fund, to
be applied to the Uses, to which the said Fund is or shall be applicable. If
all these Circumstances do not constitute a Tax, I do not know what do: the
Stamp Duties are not marked with stronger Characters, to entitle them to
that Denomination; and with respect to the Application of the Revenue, the
Power of the Parliament of Great Britain over the Colonies was then held
up much higher than it has been upon the present Occasion. The Revenue
arising from the Postage in American is blended with that of England, is
applied in Part to the carrying on of a continental War, and other public
Purposes; the Remainder of it to the Support of the Civil List; and now the
whole of it to the Discharge of the National Debt by Means of the aggregate
Fund; all these are Services that are either national or particular to Great
Britain; but the Stamp Duties and the others that were laid last Year, are
appropriated to such Services only as more particularly relate to the
Colonies; and surely if the Right of the British Parliament to impose the one
be acknowledged; that of laying on the other cannot be disputed. The Post-

Office has indeed been called a meer Convenience; which therefore the
People always chearfully pay for. After what has been said, this
Observation requires very little Notice; I will not call the Protection and
Security of the Colonies, to which the Duties in question are applied, by so
low a Name as a Convenience.
The Instances that have been mentioned prove, that the Right of the
Parliament of Great Britain to impose Taxes of every Kind on the Colonies,
has been always admitted; but were there no Precedents to support the
Claim, it would still be incontestable, being founded on the Principles of
our Constitution; for the Fact is, that the Inhabitants of the Colonies are
represented in Parliament: they do not indeed chuse the Members of that
Assembly; neither are Nine Tenths of the People of Britain Electors; for the
Right of Election is annexed to certain Species of Property, to peculiar
Franchises, and to Inhabitancy in some particular Places; but these
Descriptions comprehend only a very small Part of the Land, the Property,
and the People of this Island: all Copyhold, all Leasehold Estates, under the
Crown, under the Church, or under private Persons, tho’ for Terms ever so
long; all landed Property in short, that is not Freehold, and all monied
Property whatsoever are excluded: the Possessors of these have no Votes in
the Election of Members of Parliament; Women and Persons under Age be
their Property ever so large, and all of it Freehold, have none. The
Merchants of London, a numerous and respectable Body of Men, whose
Opulence exceeds all that America could collect; the Proprietors of that vast
Accumulation of Wealth, the public Funds; the Inhabitants of Leeds, of
Halifax, of Birmingham, and of Manchester, Towns that are each of them
larger than the Largest in the Plantations; many of less Note that are yet
incorporated; and that great Corporation the East India Company, whose
Rights over the Countries they possess, fall little short of Sovereignty, and

whose Trade and whose Fleets are sufficient to constitute them a maritime
Power, are all in the same Circumstances; none of them chuse their
Representatives; and yet are they not represented in Parliament? Is their
vast Property subject to Taxes without their Consent? Are they all
arbitrarily bound by Laws to which they have not agreed? The Colonies are
in exactly the same Situation: All British Subjects are really in the same;
none are actually, all are virtually represented in Parliament; for every
Member of Parliament sits in the House, not as Representative of his own
Constituents, but as one of that august Assembly by which all the Commons
of Great Britain are represented. Their Rights and their Interests, however
his own Borough may be affected by general Dispositions, ought to be the
great Objects of his Attention, and the only Rules for his Conduct; and to
sacrifice these to a partial Advantage in favour of the Place where he was
chosen, would be a Departure from his Duty; if it were otherwise, Old
Sarum would enjoy Privileges essential to Liberty, which are denied to
Birmingham and to Manchester; but as it is, they and the Colonies and all
British Subjects whatever, have an equal Share in the general
Representation of the Commons of Great Britain, and are bound by the
Consent of the Majority of that House, whether their own particular
Representatives consented to or opposed the Measures there taken, or
whether they had or had not particular Representatives there.
The Inhabitants of the Colonies however have by some been supposed
to be excepted, because they are represented in their respective Assemblies.
So are the Citizens of London in their Common Council; and yet so far
from excluding them from the national Representation, it does not impeach
their Right to chuse Members of Parliament: it is true, that the Powers
vested in the Common Council of London, are not equal to those which the
Assemblies in the Plantations enjoy; but still they are legislative Powers, to

be exercised within their District, and over their Citizens; yet not
exclusively of the general Superintendance of the great Council of the
Nation: The Subjects of a By-law and of an Act of Parliament may possibly
be the same; yet it never was imagined that the Privileges of London were
incompatible with the Authority of Parliament; and indeed what
Contradiction, what Absurdity, does a double Representation imply? What
difficulty is there in allowing both, tho’ both should even be vested with
equal legislative Powers, if the one is to be exercised for local, and the other
for general Purposes? and where is the Necessity that the Subordinate
Power must derogate from the superior Authority? It would be a singular
Objection to a Man’s Vote for a Member of Parliament, that being
represented in a provincial, he cannot be represented in a national
Assembly; and if this is not sufficient Ground for an Objection, neither is it
for an Exemption, or for any Pretence of an Exclusion.
The Charter and the proprietary Governments in America, are in this
Respect, on the same Footing with the Rest. The comprehending them also,
both in a provincial and national Representation, is not necessarily attended
with any Inconsistency, and nothing contained in their Grants can establish
one; for all who took those Grants were British Subjects, inhabiting British
Dominions, and who at the Time of taking, were indisputably under the
Authority of Parliament; no other Power can abridge that Authority, or
dispense with the Obedience that is due to it: those therefore, to whom the
Charters were originally given, could have no Exemption granted to them:
and what the Fathers never received, the Children cannot claim as an
Inheritance; nor was it ever in Idea that they should; even the Charters
themselves, so far from allowing guard against the Supposition.
And after all, does any Friend to the Colonies desire the Exemption?
he cannot, if he will reflect but a Moment on the Consequences. We value

the Right of being represented in the national Legislature as the dearest
Privilege we enjoy; how justly would the Colonies complain, if they alone
were deprived of it? They acknowledge Dependance upon their Mother
Country; but that Dependance would be Slavery not Connection, if they
bore no Part in the Government of the whole: they would then indeed be in
a worse Situation than the Inhabitants of Britain, for these are all of them
virtually, tho’ few of them are actually represented in the House of
Commons; if the Colonies were not, they could not expect that their
Interests and their Privileges would be any otherwise considered there, than
as subservient to those of Great Britain; for to deny the Authority of a
Legislature, is to surrender all Claims to a Share in its Councils; and if this
were the Tenor of their Charters, a Grant more insidious and more replete
with Mischief, could not have been invented: a permanent Title to a Share
in national Councils, would be exchanged for a precarious Representation
in a provincial Assembly; and a Forfeiture of their Rights would be couched
under the Appearance of Privileges; they would be reduced from Equality
to Subordination, and be at the same Time deprived of the Benefits, and
liable to the Inconveniences, both of Independency and of Connection.
Happily for them, this is not their Condition. They are on the contrary a
Part, and an important Part of the Commons of Great Britain: they are
represented in Parliament, in the same Manner as those Inhabitants of
Britain are, who have not Voices in Elections; and they enjoy, with the Rest
of their Fellow-subjects, the inestimable Privilege of not being bound by
any Laws, or subject to any Taxes, to which the Majority of the
Representatives of the Commons have not consented.
If there really were any Inconsistency between a national and a
provincial Legislature, the Consequence would be the Abolition of the
latter; for the Advantages that attend it are purely local: the District it is

confined to might be governed without it, by means of the national
Representatives; and it is unequal to great general Operations; whereas the
other is absolutely necessary for the Benefit and Preservation of the whole:
But so far are they from being incompatible, that they will be seldom found
to interfere with one another: The Parliament will not often have occasion
to exercise its Power over the Colonies, except for those Purposes, which
the Assemblies cannot provide for. A general Tax is of this Kind; the
Necessity for it, the Extent, the Application of it, are Matters which
Councils limited in their Views and in their Operations cannot properly
judge of; and when therefore the national Council determine these
Particulars, it does not encroach on the other, it only exercises a Power
which that other does not pretend to, never claimed, or wished, nor can ever
be vested with: The latter remains in exactly the same State as it was before,
providing for the same Services, by the same Means, and on the same
Subjects; but conscious of its own Inability to answer greater Purposes than
those for which it was instituted, it leaves the care of more general
Concerns to that higher Legislature, in whose Province alone the Direction
of them always was, is, and will be. The Exertion of that Authority which
belongs to its universal Superintendance, neither lowers the Dignity, nor
depreciates the Usefulness of more limited Powers: They retain all that they
ever had, and are really incapable of more.
The Concurrence therefore of the provincial Representatives cannot be
necessary in great public Measures to which none but the national
Representatives are equal: The Parliament of Great Britain not only may
but must tax the Colonies, when the public Occasions require a Revenue
there: The present Circumstances of the Nation require one now; and a
Stamp Act, of which we have had so long an Experience in this, and which
is not unknown in that Country, seems an eligible Mode of Taxation. From

all these Considerations, and from many others which will occur upon
Reflexion and need not be suggested, it must appear proper to charge
certain Stamp Duties in the Plantations to be applied towards defraying the
necessary Expences of defending, protecting, and securing the British
Colonies and Plantations in America. This Vote of the House of Commons
closed the Measures taken last Year on the Subject of the Colonies: They
appear to have been founded upon true Principles of Policy, of Commerce,
and of Finance; to be wise with respect to the Mother-Country; just and
even beneficial to the Plantations; and therefore it may reasonably be
expected that either in their immediate Operations, or in their distant
Effects, they will improve the Advantages we possess, confirm the
Blessings we enjoy, and promote the public Welfare.
FINIS.
