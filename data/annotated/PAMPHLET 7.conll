the O
Colonies B-Organization
to O
an O
Exemption O
from O
Internal O
Taxes O

by O
Authority O

Parliament B-Organization
, O
Examined O
by O
William B-Person
Knox I-Person
, O
a O
former O
colonial O
official O
. O

Americans O
read O
these O
pamphlets O
with O
great O
interest O
and O
alarm O
, O
knowing O
that O
these O
assertions O
of O
parliamentary O
power O
had O
to O
be O
answered O
. O

The O
most O
formidable O
among O
the O
rejoinders O
was O
the O
following O
anonymous O
pamphlet O
. O

Its O
author O
was O
Daniel B-Person
Dulany I-Person
, O
son O
of O
a O
prominent O
and O
wealthy O
Maryland O
family O
, O
who O
had O
been O
educated O
at O
Cambridge B-Organization
and O
studied O
law O
at O
Middle B-Organization
Temple I-Organization
in O
London B-Location
before O
returning O
home O
to O
be O
admitted O
to O
the O
Maryland O
bar O
in O
1747 O
. O

Over O
the O
next O
two O
decades O
he O
enjoyed O
a O
number O
of O
elective O
and O
appointive O
positions O
in O
the O
colony B-Organization
, O
and O
in O
1765 O
he O
was O
its O
secretary B-Organization
, O
commissary B-Organization
general I-Organization
, O
and O
a O
member O
of O
the O
governor B-Organization
’ I-Organization
s I-Organization
council I-Organization
. O

In O
his O
pamphlet O
Dulany B-Person
did O
not O
actually O
repudiate O
the O
theory O
of O
virtual O
representation O
and O
its O
claim O
that O
certain O
people O
from O
society O
, O
if O
their O
interests O
were O
identical O
with O
the O
rest O
, O
could O
justly O
speak O
for O
the O
whole O
. O

For O
Dulany B-Person
, O
the O
fallacy O
in O
Whately B-Person
’ O
s O
contention O
lay O
not O
in O
the O
inability O
of O
the O
colonists O
to O
vote O
for O
members O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
but O
rather O
in O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
English—electors O
, O
nonelectors O
, O
and O
representatives B-Organization
alike—were O
in O
no O
way O
identical O
with O
those O
of O
the O
colonists O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
he O
implied O
that O
Britons O
and O
Americans O
were O
not O
really O
one O
people O
after O
all O
. O

This O
pamphlet O
was O
quickly O
reprinted O
throughout O
the O
colonies B-Location
, O
and O
a O
London O
edition O
appeared O
the O
following O
year O
. O

Although O
he O
later O
became O
a O
Loyalist O
, O
in O
1765 O
Daniel B-Person
Dulany I-Person

was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
voices O

PREFACE O
. O

I O
T O
would O
, O
now O
, O
be O
an O
unfashionable O
Doctrine O
, O
whatever O
the O
ancient O
Opinion O
might O
be O
, O
to O
affirm O
that O
the O
Constituent O
can O
bind O
his O
Representative O
by O
Instructions O
; O
but O
tho O
’ O
the O
obligatory O
Force O
of O
these O
Instructions O
is O
not O
insisted O
upon O
, O
yet O
their O
persuasive O
Influence O
, O
in O
most O
Cases O
, O
may O
be O
; O
for O
a O
Representative O
, O
who O
should O
act O
against O
the O
explicit O
Recommendation O
of O
his O
Constituents O
, O
would O
most O
deservedly O
forfeit O
their O
Regard O
and O
all O
Pretension O
to O
their O
future O
Confidence O
. O

When O
it O
is O
under O
Deliberation O
, O
whether O
a O
new O
Law O
shall O
be O
Enacted O
, O
in O
which O
the O
Electors O
of O
England B-Location
are O
interested O
, O
THEY O
have O
Notice O
of O
it O
, O
and O
an O
Opportunity O
of O
declaring O
their O
Sense—THEY O
may O
point O
out O
every O
dangerous O
Tendency O
, O
and O
are O
not O
restrained O
in O
their O
Representations O
, O
from O
shewing O
in O
the O
plainest O
Language O
, O
the O
Injustice O
or O
Oppression O
of O
it O
. O

When O
a O
Law O
in O
it O
’ O
s O
Execution O
is O
found O
to O
be O
repugnant O
to O
the O
Genius O
of O
Liberty O
, O
or O
productive O
of O
Hardships O
or O
Inconvenience O
, O
THEY O
may O
also O
instruct O
their O
Deputies O
to O
exert O
Themselves O
in O
procuring O
a O
Repeal O
of O
it O
, O
and O
in O
the O
Exercise O
of O
this O
Right O
are O
not O
constrained O
to O
whine O
in O
the O
Style O
of O
humble O
Petitioners O
. O

— O
THEY O
are O
exposed O
to O
no O
Danger O
in O
explaining O
their O
Reasons—THEIR O
Situation O
does O
not O
become O
so O
delicate O
as O
to O
make O
it O
prudent O
, O
to O
weaken O
, O
by O
not O
urging O
them O
, O
with O
their O
full O
Force O
, O
and O
to O
their O
utmost O
Extent O
. O

But O
who O
are O
the O
Representatives B-Organization

To O
whom O
shall O
THEY O
send O
their O
Instructions O
, O
when O
desirous O
to O
obtain O
the O
Repeal O
of O
a O
Law O
striking O
at O
the O
Root O
and O
Foundation O
of O
every O
Civil O
Right O

such O
an O
one O
take O
Place O
? O

Instructions O
to O
all O
the O
Members O
who O
compose O
the O
House B-Organization
of I-Organization
Commons I-Organization
would O
not O
be O
proper O
. O

To O
them O
the O
Application O
must O
be O
by O
Petition O
, O
in O
which O
an O
unreserved O
Style O
would O
, O
probably O
, O
be O
deemed O
Indecency O
, O
and O
strong O
Expressions O
Insolence O
, O
in O
which O
a O
Claim O
of O
Rights O
may O
not O
, O
perhaps O
, O
be O
explained O
, O
or O
even O
insinuated O
, O
if O
to O
impugn O
, O
or O
glance O
at O
their O
Authority O
whose O
Relief O
is O
supplicated O
. O

To O
soften O
and O
deprecate O
must O
be O
the O
Hope O
and O
Endeavour O
, O
tho O
’ O
a O
guiltless O
Freeman O
would O
, O
probably O
, O
be O
aukward O
in O

Under O
these O
Circumstances O

the O
Liberty O

of O
the O
most O
momentous O
Consequence O

This O
Observation O

will O

that O

in O

Commons B-Organization
acted O
in O
the O
Character O

assumed O

For O
the O
Preamble O

forth O
, O
That O
the O
Commons B-Organization

had O
resolved O
to O
Give O
and O
Grant O
the O
several O
Rates O

what O
Right O

the O

the O
Consent O

Owner O

is O
such O
evident O

flagrant O
Injustice O
, O
in O
ordinary O
Cases O
, O
that O
few O
are O
hardy O
enough O
to O
avow O
it O
; O
and O
therefore O
, O
when O
it O
really O
happens O
, O
the O
Fact O
is O
disguised O

varnished O
over O
by O
the O
most O
plausible O
Pretences O

Ingenuity O
of O
the O
Giver O
can O
suggest O

But O
it O
is O
alledged O
that O
there O
is O
a O
Virtual O

Representation O
of O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
springing O
out O
of O
the O
Constitution O

And O
it O
must O
be O
confessed O
on O

this O

all O

a O

, O
after O

that O

that O

the O

A O
Reflection O
naturally O
arises O
from O
the O
Instances O
cited—When O
, O
on O
a O
particular O
Occasion O
, O
some O
Individuals O
only O
were O
to O

taxed O

and O
not O
the O
whole O
Community O
, O
their O
Consent O
only O
was O
called O
for O
, O
and O
in O
the O
last O
Instance O
it O
appears O
, O
that O
they O
, O
who O
upon O
an O
Occasion O
of O
a O
general O
Tax O
, O
would O
have O
been O
bound O
by O
the O
Consent O
of O
their O
virtual O
Representatives O
( O
for O
in O
that O
Case O
they O
would O
have O
had O
no O
actual O
Representatives O
) O
were O
in O
an O
Affair O
calling O
for O
a O
particular O
Aid O
from O
them O
, O
separate O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
Community O
, O
required O
to O
send O
their O
particular O

But O
how O
different O
would O
be O
the O
Principle O
of O
a O
Statute O
, O
imposing O
Duties O
without O
their O
Consent O
who O
are O
to O
pay O
them O
, O
upon O
the O

That O

King B-Person

a O

that O
quod O

, O
which O
by O

The O
Situation O
of O
the O
Non-Electors O
in O
England B-Location
—their O
Capacity O
to O
become O
Electors—their O
inseparable O
Connection O
with O
those O
who O
are O
Electors O
, O
and O
their O
Representatives—their O
Security O
against O
Oppression O
resulting O
from O
this O
Connection O
, O
and O
the O
Necessity O
of O
imagining O
a O
double O
or O
virtual O
Representation O
, O
to O
avoid O
Iniquity O
and O
Absurdity O
, O
have O
been O
explained—The O
Inhabitants O
of O
the O

are O
, O
as O
such O
, O
incapable O
of O
being O
Electors O
, O
the O
Privilege O
of O
Election O
being O
exerciseable O
only O
in O
Person O
, O
and O
therefore O
if O
every O
Inhabitant O
of O
America B-Location
had O
the O
requisite O
Freehold O
, O
not O
one O
could O
vote O
, O
but O
upon O
the O
Supposition O
of O
his O
ceasing O
to O
be O
an O
Inhabitant O
of O
America B-Location
, O
and O
becoming O
a O
Resident O
in O
Great-Britain B-Location
, O
a O
Supposition O
which O
would O
be O
impertinent O
, O
because O
it O
shifts O
the O
Question—Should O
the O
Colonies B-Location
not O
be O
taxed O
by O
Parliamentary O
Impositions O
, O
their O
respective O
Legislatures O
have O
a O
regular O
, O
adequate O
, O
and O
constitutional O
Authority O
to O
Tax O
them O
, O
and O
therefore O
there O
would O
not O
necessarily O
be O
an O
iniquitous O
and O
absurd O
Exemption O
, O
from O
their O
not O
being O
represented O
by O
the O
House B-Organization
of I-Organization

There O
is O
not O
that O

Relation O
between O
the O
Electors O

the O
Inhabitants O
of O
the O

which O
must O
inevitably O

Taxation O
; O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
not O
a O

actual O
Elector O

be O
immediately O

a O
Taxation O

the O
Opinion O
of O
no O

upon O

that O

The O
Objection O
having O
been O
Stated O

the O
Answer O

obvious O

The O
Colonies B-Organization
have O
a O
compleat O
and O
adequate O
Legislative O
Authority O
, O
and O
are O
not O
only O
represented O
in O

but O
in O
no O
other O
Manner O
. O

The O
Power O
of O
making O
Bye-Laws O
vested O
in O
the O
common B-Organization

is O
inadequate O

incompleat O
, O

particular O
Subjects O

the O
Common B-Organization

actually O

by O
having O
a O
Choice O
of O

to O

in O

How O
then O
can O
the O
Reason O
of O

Taxations O
, O
claimed O
by O
the O

The O
Power O
described O

the O
Exercise O

Limitations O

what O
result O
from O
their O
Subordination O

Dependance O
upon O

The O
Term O
Bye-Laws O
is O
as O
novel O
, O
and O
improper O
, O
when O
applied O
to O
the O
Assemblies B-Organization
, O
as O
the O
Expression O
Acts O
of O
Assembly B-Organization
would O
be O
, O
if O
applied O
to O
the O
Parliament B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great-Britain I-Organization
, O
and O
it O
is O
as O
absurd O
and O
insensible O
, O
to O
call O
a O
Colony O
a O
common O
Corporation O
, O
because O
not O
an O
independant O
Kingdom O
, O
and O
the O
Powers O
of O
each O
to O
make O
Laws O
and O
Bye O
Laws O
, O
are O
limited O

tho O
’ O
not O
comparable O
in O
their O
Extent O

Variety O

it O
would O

Should O
the O
Analogy O
between O

be O
even O
admitted O
for O
a O
Moment O
, O
in O

to O
see O
what O
would O
be O
the O
Consequence O
of O
the O
Postulatum O
, O
it O
would O
only O
amount O
to O
this O
, O
The O
Colonies B-Organization
are O
vested O
with O
as O
compleat O
Authority O
to O
all O
Intents O

Purposes O
to O

this O

Circumstance O

to O
prove O
the O
Impropriety O
of O

the O
British B-Organization

I O
rely O
upon O
the O
Fact O
, O
that O
not O
one O
Inhabitant O
in O
any O
Colony B-Location
is O

or O
can O
be O
actually O

therefore O
, O
that O

this O

, O
by O
Prerogative O

tax O

, O
that O

that O

the O

That O
an O

as O
much O
an O

If O

why O
did O
the O

it O

It O
appears O
to O
me O
, O
that O
there O
is O
a O
clear O

necessary O
Distinction O
between O
an O
Act O
imposing O

their O
Effect O

Operation O

The O
Colonies B-Organization
claim O
the O
Privileges O
of O
British O
Subjects—It O
has O
been O
proved O
to O
be O
inconsistent O
with O
those O
Privileges O
, O
to O
tax O
Them O
without O
their O
own O
Consent O
, O
and O
it O
hath O
been O
demonstrated O
that O
a O
Tax O
imposed O
by O
Parliament B-Organization
, O
is O
a O
Tax O
without O
their O
Consent O

The O
Subordination O
of O
the O

and O
the O
Authority O
of O
the O
Parliament B-Organization
to O
preserve O
it O
, O
have O
been O
fully O
acknowledged O
. O

Not O
only O
the O
Welfare O
, O
but O
perhaps O
the O
Existence O
of O
the O
Mother B-Organization
Country I-Organization
, O
as O
an O
independent O
Kingdom B-Organization
, O
may O
depend O
upon O
her O
Trade O

Navigation O
, O

these O
so O
far O
upon O
her O
Intercourse O
with O
the O

that O
, O
if O
this O
should O

neglected O

soon O
be O
an O
End O

the O
Right O
of O

to O
regulate O
the O

the O
Admission O

The O
Writer O

with O
Respect O
to O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
, O
who O
is O
said O
to O
have O
been O
well O
informed O
, O
asserts O
a O
Fact O
, O
which O
indisputably O
proves O
, O
that O
the O
Impositions O
mentioned O
, O
were O
only O

can O
, O
with O
no O

The O
Fact O

that O

It O
would O

with O
how O

evince O

The O
Acts O

of O

, O
could O
have O
no O
obligatory O
Force O
beyond O
the O
Limits O

the O
Service O
of O

Colony O

was O
not O
confined O
within O
the O

it O

therefore O
evident O
that O
the O

not O
an O
Authority O
adequate O

the O
great O
Object O
of O

not O
merely O
the O
Defence O

executed O

the O

attacked O

Country B-Location

and O
for O
this O
Purpose O
the O
British O
and O
American O
Troops O
acted O
conjunctly O

On O
this O
Occasion O
it O
was O
not O
only O
convenient O
, O
that O
the O
Troops O
employed O
in O
the O
same O
Service O
, O
should O
be O
subject O
to O
the O
same O
Discipline O
, O
but O
it O
was O
indispensably O
necessary O
that O
this O
Discipline O
should O
be O
established O
by O
Act O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
, O
the O
Authority O
of O
the O
Provincial B-Organization

being O
deemed O
to O
be O
incompetent O
. O

And O
it O
is O
to O
be O
remarked O
, O
moreover O
, O
that O
the O
Provincial O
Troops O
were O
raised O
and O
paid O
by O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
, O
and O
that O
it O
was O
in O
the O
Power O
of O

a O
Power O
exercised O
by O
some O
of O
Them O
, O
to O
disband O

reduce O
Them O
when O
They O
pleased O
, O
and O
therefore O
their O
supporting O
and O
keeping O
them O
up O
, O
was O
an O
effectual O
Consent O
to O
the O
Act O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
; O
but O
as O
hath O
been O
shewn O
, O
an O

as O
by O
the O
British B-Organization

there O

that O
hath O
been O

; O
but O
yet O
it O
is O
materially O
distinguishable O
from O

For O
the O

Reason O
that O
an O
Act O
of O

was O
necessary O
to O
secure O
the O
Discipline O
of O
the O
Provincial O

, O
acting O
in O
Conjunction O
with O
the O
British O
Forces O
during O
the O
late O

the O
Authority O
of O

might O
be O
proper O
for O
the O
general O
Establishment O
of O

regular O
Post-Office O

as O

Observance O

If O

should O
maliciously O
give O
a O
Wound O
in O
one O
Colony O
, O

the O
wounded O
Person O
die O
in O
another O
, O
the O
Offender O
could O
not O

This O

Superintending O
Authority O

In O

upon O
the O
Consideration O
of O
the O
general O
Convenience O
and O
Accommodation O
arising O
from O
the O
Establishment O
, O
the O
People O
of O
America B-Location
have O
not O
complained O
of O
it O
, O
but O
if O
this O
Instance O
were O
more O
pertinent O
than O
it O
is O
, O
it O
would O
only O
prove O
what O
hath O
been O
too O
often O
proved O
before—When O
Men O

not O

any O
Designs O
to O

Steps O

Tendency O
, O
They O
are O
frequently O
involved O
in O
Ruin O
before O
they O
are O

of O
Danger O
, O
or O
that O
the O
Conduct O
flowing O
from O

When O
Instances O
are O
urged O
as O
an O
authoritative O
Reason O
for O
adopting O
a O
new O
Measure O
, O
They O
are O
proved O
to O
be O
more O
important O
from O
this O
Use O
of O
Them O
, O
and O
ought O
therefore O
to O
be O
reviewed O
with O
Accuracy O
, O
and O
canvassed O
with O
Strictness O
. O

What O
is O
proposed O
ought O
to O
be O
incorporated O
with O
what O
hath O
been O
done O
, O
and O
the O
Result O
of O
both O
stated O
and O
considered O
as O
a O
substantive O
original O
Question O
, O
and O
if O
the O
Measure O
proposed O
is O
incompatible O
with O
the O
constitutional O
Rights O
of O
the O
Subject O
, O
it O
is O
so O
far O
from O
being O
a O
rational O
Argument O
, O
that O
Consistency O
requires O
an O
Adoption O
of O
the O
proposed O
Measure O
, O
that O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
suggests O
the O
strongest O
Motive O
for O
abolishing O
the O
Precedent O
; O
when O
therefore O
an O
Instance O
of O
Deviation O
from O
the O
Constitution O
is O
pressed O
as O
a O
Reason O
for O
the O
Establishment O
of O
a O
Measure O
striking O
at O
the O
very O
Root O
of O
all O
Liberty O
; O
tho O
’ O
the O
Argument O
is O
inconclusive O
, O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
useful O
. O

Wherefore O
if O
a O
sufficient O
Answer O
were O
not O
given O
to O
the O
Argument O
drawn O
from O
Precedents O
, O
by O
shewing O
that O
none O
of O
the O
Instances O
adduced O
are O
applicable O
, O
I O
should O
have O
very O
little O
Difficulty O
in O
denying O
the O
Justice O
of O
the O
Principle O
on O
which O
it O
is O
founded O
. O

What O
hath O
been O
done O
, O
if O
wrongful O
, O
confers O
no O
Right O
to O
repeat O
it O
. O

To O
justify O
Oppression O
and O
Outrage O
, O
by O
Instances O
of O
their O
Commission O
, O
is O
a O
Kind O
of O
Argument O
which O
never O
can O
produce O
Conviction O
, O
tho O
’ O
it O
may O
their O
Acquiescence O
, O
whom O
the O
Terror O
of O
greater O
Evils O
may O
restrain O
from O
resisting O
, O
and O
thus O
the O
Despotism O
of O
the O
East O
may O
be O
supported O
, O
and O
the O
natural O
Rights O
of O
Mankind O
be O
trampled O
under O
Feet O
. O

The O
Question O
of O
Right O
, O
therefore O
, O
doth O
not O
depend O
upon O
Precedents O
, O
but O
on O
the O
Principles O
of O
the O
Constitution O
, O
and O
hath O
been O
put O
upon O
it O
’ O
s O
proper O
Point O
already O
discussed O
, O
whether O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
are O
represented O
or O
not O
, O
in O
Parliament B-Organization
. O

As O
the O
Name O
of O
Hampden O
occurred O
to O
the O
Examiner B-Person
in O
his O
Design O
of O
casting O
an O
oblique O
Reflection O
upon O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
, O
it O
is O
surprising O
he O
did O
not O
recollect O
, O
that O
very O
numerous O
Precedents O
have O
been O
applied O
in O
the O
Defence O
of O
an O
arbitrary O
and O
oppressive O
Proceeding O
, O
destructive O
of O
the O
essential O
Principle O
of O
English O
Liberty O
. O

But O
tho O
’ O
meer O
Acts O
of O
Power O
prove O
no O
Right O
, O
yet O
the O
real O
Opinion O
entertained O
of O
it O
, O
may O
be O
inferred O
from O
Forbearance O
; O
for O
Mankind O
are O
generally O
so O
fond O
of O
Power O
, O
that O
they O
are O
oftener O
tempted O
to O
exercise O
it O
beyond O
the O
Limits O
of O
Justice O
, O
than O
induced O
to O
set O
Bounds O
to O
it O
from O
the O
pure O
Consideration O
of O
the O
Rectitude O
of O
Forbearance O
. O

Wherefore O
if O
I O
had O
deny O
’ O
d O
the O
Principle O
of O
this O
Kind O
of O
Reasoning O
, O
without O
shewing O
the O
Defects O
of O
the O
artificial O
painted O
Precedents O
which O
have O
been O
produced O
, O
I O
might O
still O
very O
consistently O
urge O
, O
that O
, O
the O
repeated O
and O
uniform O
Requisitions O
of O
the O
English B-Organization
Ministers I-Organization
, O
as O
often O
as O
Occasions O
for O
the O
single O
Purpose O
of O
Revenue O
have O
happened O
, O
transmitted O
to O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
to O
tax O
Themselves O
by O
Provincial O
Acts O
, O
and O
the O
Acts O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
regulating O
the O
Trade O
of O
the O
Plantations B-Organization
, O
as O
well O
as O
of O
Ireland B-Organization
, O
without O
one O
Instance O
, O
before O
the O
Stamp-Act O
of O
a O
Tax O
imposed O
by O
Parliament B-Organization
upon O
either O
, O
for O
the O
unmixed O
Purpose O
of O
Revenue O
prove O
, O
that O
the O
Imposition O
of O
a O
Tax O
upon O
them O
without O
their O
Consent O
, O
hath O
constantly O
been O
held O
to O
be O
inconsistent O
with O
their O
Constitutional O
Rights O
and O
Privileges O
. O

I O
have O
joined O
Ireland B-Organization
with O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
, O
and O
presume O
it O
will O
hardly O
be O
contended O
that O
Ireland B-Organization
, O
over O
which O
the O
Courts B-Organization
of I-Organization
Justice I-Organization
in O
England B-Location
have O
a O
superintendant O
Power O
, O
is O
not O
, O
at O
least O
, O
as O
subject O
to O
Great-Britain B-Organization
as O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
are O
. O

A O
most O
extraordinary O
Reason O
hath O
been O
given O
, O
why O
the O
Method O
of O
Requisition O
would O
have O
been O
improper O
, O
viz O
. O
that O
“ O
the O
Sums O
raised O
must O
be O
paid O
into O
the O
Exchequer O
, O
and O
if O
levied O
by O
the O
Provincial B-Organization
Assemblies I-Organization
, O
the O
Parliament B-Organization
would O
have O
no O
Right O
to O
enquire O
into O
the O
Expenditure O
of O
them O
. O
” O

This O
is O
so O
extremely O
futile O
, O
that O
it O
would O
be O
almost O
absurd O
to O
bestow O
a O
serious O
Refutation O
upon O
it O
. O

Why O
must O
the O
Sums O
raised O
be O
paid O
into O
the O
Exchequer O
? O

If O
the O
Intention O
is O
to O
apply O
them O
in O
the O
Colonies B-Location
to O
any O
internal O
Purpose O
, O
why O
must O
they O
be O
remitted O
to O
Great-Britain B-Location

If O

kept O
up O

why O

Does O
the O

in O
his O
Idea O

figure O
to O
himself O
a O

It O
is O
not O
so O
difficult O
for O
Men O
to O
strike O

Methods O
of O

some O
seem O
to O
apprehend O

It O
is O
not O
contended O
that O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
ought O
to O
be O
indulged O
in O
a O
general O
Liberty O
of O
Exporting O
and O
Importing O
every O
Thing O
in O
what O
Manner O
they O
please O
, O
but O
, O
since O
they O
are O
hindered O
from O
making O
all O
the O
Advantages O
they O
might O
do O
, O
and O
what O
Advantages O
might O
they O
not O
make O
, O
if O
under O
no O
Checks O
? O

They O
have O
a O
good O
Plea O
against O
all O
Rigour O
and O
Severity O
, O
not O
absolutely O
necessary O
. O

That O
British O
Manufactures O
come O
dearer O
, O
and O
not O
so O
good O
in O
Quality O
to O
America B-Location
, O
as O
formerly O
, O
is O
a O
very O
general O
Complaint O
, O
and O
what O
Effect O
it O
may O
have O
, O
should O
they O
still O
grow O
dearer O
and O
worse O
in O
Quality O
, O
or O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
be O
rendered O
less O
able O
to O
consume O
them O
, O
is O
a O
Consideration O
which O
concerns O
Great-Britain B-Organization
, O
at O
least O
as O
much O
as O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
. O

An O
increase O
of O
Price O
, O
and O
falling O
in O
the O
Goodness O
of O
Quality O
, O
is O
the O
usual O
Effect O
of O
Monopolies O
; O
there O
is O
no O
Danger O
of O
Foreigners O
taking O
Advantage O
of O
this O
Circumstance O
in O
America B-Location
, O
whatever O
they O
may O
do O
in O
other O
Countries O
; O
but O
the O
Industry O
it O
may O
give O
Rise O
to O
in O
America B-Location
, O
when O
other O
Circumstances O
concur O
, O
is O
not O
difficult O
to O
be O
foreseen O
. O

It O
must O
be O
acknowledged O
, O
that O
the O
Balance O
of O
Trade O
between O
GreatBritain B-Organization
and O
her O
Colonies B-Organization
, O
is O
considerably O
against O
the O
latter O
, O
and O
that O
no O
Gold O
or O
Silver O
Mines O
have O
yet O
been O
discovered O
in O
the O
old O
American B-Location
Settlements I-Location
, O
or O
among O
the O
Treasures O
of O
the O
new O
Acquisitions O
. O

How O
then O
is O
this O
Balance O
to O
be O
discharged O
? O

The O
former O
Trade O
of O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
, O
which O
enabled O
them O
to O
keep O
up O
their O
Credit O
with O
Great-Britain B-Organization
, O
by O
applying O
the O
Balance O
they O
gained O
against O
Foreigners O
, O
is O
now O
so O
fettered O
with O
Difficulties O
, O
as O
to O
be O
almost O
prohibited O
. O

In O
order O
therefore O
to O
reduce O
the O
Balance O
against O
them O
upon O
the O
Trade O
between O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
and O
Great-Britain B-Organization
, O
this O
Trade O
must O
be O
contracted O
, O
so O
as O
to O
bring O
the O
Scales O
to O
an O
Equilibrium O
, O
or O
a O
Debt O
will O
be O
incurred O
that O
can O
’ O
t O
be O
paid O
off O
, O
which O
will O
distress O
the O
Creditor O
as O
well O
as O
the O
Debtor O
, O
by O
the O
Insolvency O
of O
the O
latter O
. O

The O
Income O
also O
of O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
, O
which O
was O
before O
invested O
in O
their O
Trade O
, O
will O
be O
diminished O
in O
Proportion O
to O
the O
Produce O
of O
the O
Stamp-Act O
, O
and O
therefore O
the O
Amount O
of O
that O
Produce O
must O
be O
drawn O
out O
, O
which O
will O
create O
a O
further O
Reduction O
of O
the O
Trade O
. O

I O
confess O
that O
I O
am O
one O
of O
those O
who O
do O
not O
perceive O
the O
Policy O
in O
laying O
Difficulties O
and O
Obstructions O
upon O
the O
gainful O
Trade O
of O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
with O
Foreigners O
, O
or O
that O
it O
even O
makes O
any O
real O
Difference O
to O
the O
English B-Organization
Nation I-Organization
, O
whether O
the O
Merchants O
who O
carry O
it O
on O

New-York B-Location
or O
Boston B-Location
, O
London B-Location

or O
Liverpool B-Location
, O
when O
the O
Balance O
gained O
by O
the O
American O
Merchant O
in O
the O
Pursuit O
of O
that O
Trade O
centers O
in O
Great-Britain B-Location
, O
and O
is O
applied O
to O
the O
Discharge O
of O
a O
Debt O
contracted O
by O
the O
Consumption O
of O

Manufactures O
in O
the O
Colonies B-Location
, O
and O
in O
this O
to O
the O
Support O
of O
the O
national O
Expence O

If O
in O
Consequence O
of O
the O
Obstructions O

as O
they O
are O
called O

of O
their O
Commerce O

the O
Imposition O

the O

should O
only O
be O
driven O
to O
observe O
the O
strictest O
Maxims O
of O
Frugality O
, O
the O
Consequence O
would O
rather O
be O
disagreeable O
than O
hurtful—Should O
they O
be O
forced O
to O
use O
new O
Methods O
of O
Industry O
, O
and O
to O
have O
Recourse O
to O
Arts O
for O
a O
Supply O
of O
Necessaries O
, O
the O
Difficulty O
in O
Succeeding O
would O
prove O
less O
than O
the O
Apprehension O
of O
Miscarrying O
, O
and O
the O
Benefit O
greater O
than O
the O
Hope O
of O
it O
. O

There O
are O
few O
People O
of O
the O
highest O
, O
and O
even O
of O
the O
middle O
Rank O
, O
but O
would O
upon O
a O
strict O
Scrutiny O
into O
their O
ordinary O
Disbursements O
, O
discover O
some O
Articles O
that O
would O
admit O
of O
Defalcation O
. O

A O
prudent O
Man O
, O
constrained O
to O
abridge O
his O
Outgoings O

will O
consider O
what O
Articles O
of O

may O
be O
retrenched O

given O
up O

without O
Distress O
or O
Discomfort O

if O
, O
after O
this O
saving O
, O
he O
still O
finds O
that O
his O
Expences O
exceed O
his O
Income O
, O
he O
will O
then O
consider O
of O
what O
Articles O
he O
can O
provide O
a O
Supply O
by O
the O
Application O
of O
domestic O
Industry O
, O
or O
whether O
some O
tolerable O
Substitute O
may O
not O
be O
fallen O
upon O

answer O
the O
Purpose O
of O
what O
he O
can O
neither O
buy O

nor O

Skill O

He O
will O
reflect O
that O
the O
Expedient O
which O
is O
at O
first O
but O
an O
indifferent O
Shift O
, O
Use O
and O
Experience O
will O
improve O

Reconcilement O

What O

As O
for O

it O

This O

For O
, O
tho O

before O

that O

there O
is O
great O
Reason O
to O

that O
if O

But O
when O

the O

Part O
of O

Price O
of O
the O
Commodity O
, O
and O
therefore O
lowers O
his O
Price O
to O
the O
Merchant O
in O
Proportion O

It O
appears O
then O
, O
that O
the O
whole O
Tax O
is O
upwards O
of O
