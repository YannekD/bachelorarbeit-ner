Boston B-Location
, O
1764 O
. O

In O
1733 O
the O
British B-Organization
government I-Organization
had O
levied O
a O
prohibitory O
high O
duty O
of O
six O
pence O
a O
gallon O
on O
foreign O
molasses O
imported O
into O
the O
North B-Location
American I-Location
colonies I-Location
. O

This O
had O
been O
designed O
to O
keep O
French O
West O
Indian O
molasses—a O
by-product O
of O
sugar O
refining O
used O
in O
the O
making O
of O
rum—out O
of O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
colonists O
in O
order O
to O
prevent O
them O
from O
developing O
a O
rum O
industry O
that O
would O
rival O
that O
of O
the O
British O
West O
Indian O
sugar O
planters O
. O

By O
contrast O
, O
France B-Organization
, O
fearing O
competition O
to O
its O
wine O
and O
brandy O
industry O
, O
had O
forbidden O
its O
colonial O
sugar O
planters O
from O
using O
their O
own O
surplus O
molasses O
to O
make O
rum O
. O

Hence O
the O
French O
planters O
always O
had O
lots O
of O
leftover O
molasses O
to O
sell O
. O

Since O
the O
high O
tariff O
had O
not O
kept O
foreign O
molasses O
out O
of O
the O
English B-Location
colonies I-Location
—the O
Americans O
being O
very O
efficient O
smugglers O
and O
rum O
producers—the O
British B-Organization
administration I-Organization
finally O
concluded O
in O
1764 O
that O
lowering O
the O
tariff O
to O
three O
pence O
a O
gallon O
not O
only O
would O
make O
it O
revenue-generating O
but O
would O
eliminate O
the O
colonists O
’ O
need O
to O
smuggle O
molasses O
and O
bribe O
customs O
officials O
. O

The O
former O
prohibitory O
tariff O
designed O
in O
1733 O
to O
regulate O
colonial O
trade O
now O
suddenly O
appeared O
to O
resemble O
a O
tax O
. O

This O
Sugar O
Act O
of O
1764 O
and O
the O
accompanying O
new O
trade O
regulations O
signaled O
a O
change O
in O
the O
longstanding O
relationship O
between O
the O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
and O
America B-Organization
. O

These O
initial O
efforts O
at O
imperial O
reform O
stirred O
up O
a O
series O
of O
colonial O
protests O
and O
writings O
, O
of O
which O
this O
pamphlet O
by O
James B-Person
Otis I-Person
of O
Massachusetts B-Location
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
radical O
and O
far-reaching O
. O

Reprinted O
in O
London B-Location
before O
the O
year O
was O
out O
, O
it O
was O
advertised O
there O
as O
“ O
universally O
approved O
” O
of O
in O
the O
colonies B-Location
and O
“ O
highly O
necessary O
for O
the O
perusal O
of O
the O
members O
of O
both B-Organization
houses I-Organization
, O
and O
of O
such O
who O
chuse O
to O
make O
themselves O
masters O
of O
an O
argument O
so O
little O
understood O
, O
but O
of O
so O
great O
consequence O
to O
every O
British O
subject O
, O
and O
lover O
of O
constitutional O
Liberty O
. O
” O

Just O
as O
it O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
influential O
pamphlets O
of O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
the O
American O
crisis O
, O
Otis B-Person
’ O
s O
Rights O
was O
also O
one O
of O
the O
most O
complicated O
and O
seemingly O
self-contradictory O
, O
here O
avowing O
that O
Parliament B-Organization
’ O
s O
“ O
uncontrollable O
” O
power O
must O
be O
obeyed O
, O
there O
averring O
that O
no O
legislature O
, O
not O
even O
Parliament B-Organization
, O
could O
deprive O
individuals—and O
remarkably O
for O
his O
time O
, O
he O
makes O
clear O
he O
does O
not O
mean O
just O
white O
individuals—of O
their O
natural O
rights O
. O

The O
apparent O
contradiction O
disappears O
once O
it O
is O
understood O
that O
Otis B-Person
conceived O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
in O
an O
old-fashioned O
, O
even O
medieval O
sense O
and O
in O
the O
same O
terms O
that O
Chief B-Person
Justice I-Person
Edward I-Person
Coke I-Person
had O
invoked O
in O
the O
seventeenth O
century O
. O

Parliament B-Organization
to O
Otis B-Person
, O
as O
it O
was O
to O
Coke B-Person
, O
was O
a O
court O
that O
discovered O
the O
law O
, O
not O
a O
legislature O
that O
willed O
it O
. O

Parliament B-Organization
was O
undoubtedly O
supreme O
, O
but O
, O
like O
any O
court O
administering O
the O
common O
law O
, O
it O
could O
never O
be O
arbitrary O
; O
as O
soon O
as O
it O
discovered O
any O
mistake O
it O
had O
made O
, O
it O
would O
correct O
it O
, O
just O
as O
Coke B-Person
had O
corrected O
Parliament B-Organization
in O

when O
it O

mistakenly O
made O
a O
man O

judge O
in O
his O
own O
cause O
in O
violation O
of O
the O
common O

. O

At O
once O
outdated O
and O
visionary O
, O

to O
a O
legal O
fiction O
at O
odds O
with O
the O
realities O
of O

politics O
even O
as O
it O
argued O
for O
natural O
rights O
in O
a O
way O
that O
many O
regarded O
as O
dangerously O
revolutionary O

INTRODUCTION O
OF O
THE O
ORIGIN O
OF O
GOVERNMENT O
. O

T O
HE O
origin O
of O
government O
has O
in O
all O
ages O
no O
less O
perplexed O
the O
heads O
of O
lawyers O
and O
politicians O
, O
than O
the O
origin O
of O
evil O
has O
embarrassed O
divines O
and O
philosophers O
: O
And O
’ O
tis O
probable O
the O
world O
may O
receive O
a O
satisfactory O
solution O
on O
both O
those O
points O
of O
enquiry O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

The O
various O
opinions O
on O
the O
origin O
of O
government O
have O
been O
reduced O
to O
four O
. O
1 O
. O

That O
dominion O
is O
founded O
in O
Grace O
. O
2 O
. O

On O
force O
or O
meer O
power O
. O
3 O
. O

On O
compact O
. O
4 O
. O

On O
property O
. O

The O
first O
of O
these O
opinions O
is O
so O
absurd O
, O
and O
the O
world O
has O
paid O
so O
very O
dear O
for O
embracing O
it O
, O
especially O
under O
the O
administration O
of O
the O
roman B-Organization
pontiffs I-Organization
, O
that O
mankind O
seem O
at O
this O
day O
to O
be O
in O
a O
great O
measure O
cured O
of O
their O
madness O
in O
this O
particular O
; O
and O
the O
notion O
is O
pretty O
generally O
exploded O
, O
and O
hiss O
’ O
d O
off O
the O
stage O
. O

To O
those O
who O
lay O
the O
foundation O
of O
government O
in O
force O
and O
meer O
brutal O
power O
, O
it O
is O
objected O
; O
that O
, O
their O
system O
destroys O
all O
distinction O
between O
right O
and O
wrong O
; O
that O
it O
overturns O
all O
morality O
, O
and O
leaves O
it O
to O
every O
man O
to O
do O
what O
is O
right O
in O
his O
own O
eyes O
; O
that O
it O
leads O
directly O
to O
scepticism O
, O
and O
ends O
in O
atheism O
. O

When O
a O
man O
’ O
s O
will O
and O
pleasure O
is O
his O
only O
rule O
and O
guide O
, O
what O
safety O
can O
there O
be O
either O
for O
him O
or O
against O
him O
, O
but O
in O
the O
point O
of O
a O
sword O
? O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
the O
gentlemen O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
original O
compact O
have O
been O
often O
told O
that O
their O
system O
is O
chimerical O
and O
unsupported O
by O
reason O
or O
experience O
. O

Questions O
like O
the O
following O
have O
been O
frequently O
asked O
them O
, O
and O
may O
be O
again O
. O

“ O
When O
and O
where O
was O
the O
original O
compact O
for O
introducing O
government O
into O
any O
society O
, O
or O
for O
creating O
a O
society O
, O
made O
? O

Who O
were O
present O
and O
parties O
to O
such O
compact O
? O

Who O
acted O
for O
infants O
and O
women O
, O
or O
who O
appointed O
guardians O
for O
them O
? O

Had O
these O
guardians O
power O
to O
bind O
both O
infants O
and O
women O
during O
life O
, O
and O
their O
posterity O
after O
them O
? O

Is O
it O
in O
nature O
or O
reason O
that O
a O
guardian O
should O
by O
his O
own O
act O
perpetuate O
his O
power O
over O
his O
ward O
, O
and O
bind O
him O
and O
his O
posterity O
in O
chains O
? O

Is O
not O
every O
man O
born O
as O
free O
by O
nature O
as O
his O
father O
? O

Has O
he O
not O
the O
same O
natural O
right O
to O
think O
and O
act O
and O
contract O
for O
himself O
? O

Is O
it O
possible O
for O
a O
man O
to O
have O
a O
natural O
right O
to O
make O
a O
slave O
of O
himself O
or O
of O
his O
posterity O
? O

Can O
a O
father O
supersede O
the O
laws O
of O
nature O
? O

What O
man O
is O
or O
ever O
was O
born O
free O
, O
if O
every O
man O
is O
not O
? O

What O
will O
there O
be O
to O
distinguish O
the O
next O
generation O
of O
men O
from O
their O
forefathers O
, O
that O
they O
should O
not O
have O
the O
same O
right O
to O
make O
original O
compacts O
as O
their O
ancestors O
had O
? O

If O
every O
man O
has O
such O
right O
, O
may O
there O
not O
be O
as O
many O
original O
compacts O
as O
there O
are O
men O
and O
women O
born O
or O
to O
be O
born O
? O

Are O
not O
women O
born O
as O
free O
as O
men O
? O

Would O
it O
not O
be O
infamous O
to O
assert O
that O
the O
ladies O
are O
all O
slaves O
by O
nature O
? O

If O
every O
man O
and O
woman O
born O
or O
to O
be O
born O
has O
, O
and O
will O
have O
, O
a O
right O
to O
be O
consulted O
, O
and O
must O
accede O
to O
the O
original O
compact O
before O
they O
can O
with O
any O
kind O
of O
justice O
be O
said O
to O
be O
bound O
by O
it O
, O
will O
not O
the O
compact O
be O
ever O
forming O
and O
never O
finished O
, O
ever O
making O
but O
never O
done O
? O

Can O
it O
with O
propriety O
be O
called O
a O
compact O
original O
or O
derivative O
, O
that O
is O
ever O
in O
treaty O
but O
never O
concluded O
? O
” O

When O
it O
has O
been O
said O
that O
each O
man O
is O
bound O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
accedes O
, O
and O
that O
the O
consent O
may O
be O
either O
express O

tacit O
, O
it O
has O
been O
asked O
, O
“ O
What O
is O
a O
tacit O
consent O

compact O

Does O
it O
not O
appear O
plain O
that O
those O
who O
refuse O
their O
assent O
can O
not O
be O
bound O
? O

If O
one O
is O
at O
liberty O
to O

not O
, O
is O
he O
not O
also O
at O
liberty O
to O
recede O
on O

discovery O
of O
some O
intolerable O
fraud O
and O

has O
been O

upon O
him O
by O

rest O
of O

Will O
not O

in O
several O
special O
cases O
rescind O
the O
original O
compacts O
of O
great O
men O
as O
effectualy O
as O

of O
little O
men O
are O
rendered O
null O
and O
void O
in O
the O
ordinary O
course O
of O

court O

? O
” O

There O
are O
other O
questions O
which O
have O
been O
started O
, O
and O
a O
resolution O
of O
them O
demanded O
, O
which O
may O
perhaps O
be O
deemed O
indecent O
by O
those O
who O
hold O
the O
prerogatives O
of O
an O
earthly O
monarch O
, O
and O
even O
the O
power O
of O
a O
plantation O
government O
, O
so O
sacred O
as O
to O
think O
it O
little O
less O
than O
blasphemy O
to O
enquire O
into O
their O
origin O
and O
foundation O
: O
while O
the O
government O
of O
the O
supreme O
ruler O
of O
the O
universe O
is O
every O
day O
discussed O
with O
less O
ceremony O
and O
decency O
than O

administration O
of O

petty O
German O
prince O
. O

I O
hope O
the O
reader O
will O
consider O
that O
I O
am O
at O
present O
only O
mentioning O
such O
questions O
as O
have O
been O
put O
by O
high-flyers O

that O

what O

it O

playing O
with O
words O
? O

Dominion O
in O
one O
sense O
of O
the O
term O
is O
synonimous O
with O
property O
, O
so O
one O
cannot O
be O
called O
the O
foundation O
of O
the O
other O
, O
but O
as O
one O
name O
may O
appear O
to O
be O
the O
foundation O
or O
cause O
of O
another O
. O

Property O
cannot O
be O
the O
foundation O
of O
dominion O
as O
synonimous O
with O
government O
; O
for O
on O
the O
supposition O
that O
property O
has O
a O
precarious O
existence O
antecedent O
to O
government O
, O
and O
tho O
’ O
it O
is O
also O
admitted O
that O
the O
security O
of O
property O
is O
one O
end O
of O
government O
, O
but O
that O
of O
little O
estimation O
even O
in O
the O
view O
of O
a O
miser O
when O
life O
and O
liberty O
of O
locomotion O
and O
further O
accumulation O
are O
placed O
in O
competition O
, O
it O
must O
be O
a O
very O
absurd O
way O
of O
speaking O
to O
assert O
that O
one O
end O
of O
government O
is O
the O
foundation O
of O
government O
. O

If O
the O
ends O
of O
government O
are O
to O
be O
considered O
as O
its O
foundation O
, O
it O
cannot O
with O
truth O
or O
propriety O
be O
said O
that O
government O
is O
founded O
on O
any O
one O
of O
those O
ends O
; O
and O
therefore O
government O
is O
not O
founded O
on O
property O
or O
its O
security O
alone O
, O
but O
at O
least O
on O
something O
else O
in O
conjunction O
. O

It O
is O
however O
true O
in O
fact O
and O
experience O
, O
as O
the O
great O
, O
the O
incomparable O
Harrington B-Person
has O
most O
abundantly O
demonstrated O
in O
his O
Oceana O
, O
and O
other O
divine O
writings O
, O
that O
Empire O
follows O
the O
balance O
of O
property O
: O
’ O
Tis O
also O
certain O
that O
property O
in O
fact O
generally O
confers O
power O
, O
tho O
’ O
the O
possessor O
of O
it O
may O
not O
have O
much O
more O
wit O
than O
a O
mole O
or O
a O
musquash O
: O
And O
this O
is O
too O
often O
the O
cause O
, O
that O
riches O
are O
sought O
after O
, O
without O
the O
least O
concern O
about O
the O
right O
application O
of O
them O
. O

But O
is O
the O
fault O
in O
the O
riches O
, O
or O
the O
general O
law O
of O
nature O
, O
or O
the O
unworthy O
possessor O
? O

It O
will O
never O
follow O
from O
all O
this O
, O
that O
government O
is O
rightfully O
founded O
on O
property O
, O
alone O
. O

What O
shall O
we O
say O
then O
? O

Is O
not O
government O
founded O
on O
grace O
? O

No O
. O

Nor O
on O
force O
? O

No O
. O

Nor O
on O
compact O
? O

Nor O
property O
? O

Not O
altogether O
on O
either O
. O

Has O
it O
any O
solid O
foundation O
? O

any O
chief O
corner O
stone O
, O
but O
what O
accident O
, O
chance O
or O
confusion O
may O
lay O
one O
moment O
and O
destroy O
the O
next O
? O

I O
think O
it O
has O
an O
everlasting O
foundation O
in O
the O
unchangeable O
will O
of O
GOD O
, O
the O
author O
of O
nature O
, O
whose O
laws O
never O
vary O
. O

The O
same O
omniscient O
, O
omnipotent O
, O
infinitely O
good O
and O
gracious O
Creator O
of O
the O
universe O
, O
who O
has O
been O
pleased O
to O
make O
it O
necessary O
that O
what O
we O
call O
matter O
should O
gravitate O
, O
for O
the O
celestial O
bodies O
to O
roll O
round O
their O
axes O
, O
dance O
their O
orbits O
and O
perform O
their O
various O
revolutions O
in O
that O
beautiful O
order O
and O
concert O
, O
which O
we O
all O
admire O
, O
has O
made O
it O
equally O
necessary O
that O
from O
Adam B-Person
and O
Eve B-Person
to O
these O
degenerate O
days O
, O
the O
different O
sexes O
should O
sweetly O
attract O
each O
other O
, O
form O
societies O
of O
single O
families O
, O
of O
which O
larger O
bodies O
and O
communities O
are O
as O
naturally O
, O
mechanically O
, O
and O
necessarily O
combined O
, O
as O
the O
dew O
of O
Heaven O
and O
the O
soft O
distilling O
rain O
is O
collected O
by O
the O
all O
enliv O
’ O
ning O

of O
the O
sun O
. O

Government O
is O
therefore O
most O
evidently O
founded O
on O
the O
necessities O
of O
our O
nature O
. O

It O
is O
by O
no O
means O
an O
arbitrary O
thing O
, O
depending O
merely O
on O
compact O
or O
human O
will O
for O
its O
existence O
. O

We O
come O
into O
the O
world O
forlorn O
and O
helpless O
; O
and O
if O
left O
alone O
and O
to O
ourselves O
at O
any O
one O
period O
of O
our O
lives O
, O
we O
should O
soon O
die O
in O
want O
, O
despair O
or O
destraction O
. O

So O
kind O
is O
that O
hand O
, O
tho O
’ O
little O
known O
or O
regarded O
, O
which O
feeds O
the O
rich O
and O
the O
poor O
, O
the O
blind O
and O
the O
naked O
; O
and O
provides O
for O
the O
safety O
of O
infants O
by O
the O
principle O
of O
parental O
love O
, O
and O
for O
that O
of O
men O
by O
Government O

We O
have O
a O
King B-Organization
, O
who O
neither O
slumbers O
nor O
sleeps O
, O
but O
eternally O
watches O
for O
our O
good O
; O
whose O
rain O
falls O
on O
the O
just O
and O
on O
the O
unjust O
: O
yet O
while O
they O
live O
, O
move O
, O
and O
have O
their O
being O
in O
him O
, O
and O
cannot O
account O
for O
either O
, O
or O
for O
any O
thing O
else O
, O
so O
stupid O
and O
wicked O
are O
some O
men O
, O
as O
to O
deny O
his O
existence O
, O
blaspheme O
his O
most O
evident O
government O
, O
and O
disgrace O
their O
nature O
. O

Let O
no O
Man O
think O
I O
am O
about O
to O
commence O
advocate O
for O
despotism O
, O
because O
I O
affirm O
that O
government O
is O
founded O
on O
the O
necessity O
of O
our O
natures O
; O
and O
that O
an O
original O
supreme O
Sovereign O
, O
absolute O
, O
and O
uncontroulable O
, O
earthly O
power O
must O
exist O
in O

preside O
over O

society O
; O
from O
whose O
final O
decisions O
there O
can O
be O
no O
appeal O

directly O
to O
Heaven O

It O
is O
therefore O
originally O

I O
say O
this O
supreme O
absolute O
power O
is O
originally O
and O
ultimately O
in O
the O
people O
; O
and O
they O
never O
did O
in O
fact O
freely O
, O
nor O
can O
they O
rightfully O
make O
an O
absolute O
, O
unlimited O
renunciation O
of O
this O
divine O
right O

It O
is O
ever O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
thing O
given O
in O
trust O
, O
and O
on O
a O
condition O
, O
the O
performance O
of O
which O
no O
mortal O
can O
dispence O
with O
; O
namely O
, O
that O
the O
person O
or O
persons O
on O
whom O
the O
sovereignty O
is O

by O
the O
people O

Tyranny O

whether O

— O
And O
tho O
’ O
“ O
in O
the O
last O
age O
a O
generation O
of O
men O
sprung O
up O
that O
would O
flatter O
Princes O
with O
an O
opinion O
that O
they O
have O
a O
divine O
right O
to O
absolute O
power O
” O
; O
yet O
“ O
slavery O
is O
so O
vile O
and O
miserable O
an O
estate O
of O
man O
, O
and O
so O
directly O
opposite O
to O
the O
generous O
temper O
and O
courage O
of O
our O
nation B-Organization
, O
that O
’ O
tis O
hard O
to O
be O
conceived O
that O
an O
englishman O
, O
much O
less O
a O
gentleman O
, O
should O
plead O
for O
it O
: O
” O
3 O
Especially O
at O
a O
time O
when O
the O
finest O
writers O
of O
the O
most O
polite O
nations O
on O
the O
continent B-Location
of I-Location
Europe I-Location
, O
are O
enraptured O
with O
the O
beauties O
of O
the O
civil O
constitution O
of O
Great-Britain B-Organization
; O
and O
envy O
her O
, O
no O
less O
for O
the O
freedom O
of O
her O
sons O
, O
than O
for O
her O
immense O
wealth O
and O
military O
glory O
. O

But O
let O
the O
origin O
of O
government O
be O
placed O
where O
it O
may O
, O
the O
end O
of O
it O
is O
manifestly O
the O
good O
of O
the O
whole O
. O

Salus O
populi O
suprema O
lex O
esto O
, O
is O
of O
the O
law O
of O
nature O
, O
and O
part O
of O
that O
grand O
charter O
given O
the O
human O
race O
, O
( O
tho O
’ O
too O
many O
of O
them O
are O
afraid O
to O
assert O
it O
, O
) O
by O
the O
only O
monarch O
in O
the O
universe O
, O
who O
has O
a O
clear O
and O
indisputable O
right O
to O
absolute O
power O
; O
because O
he O
is O
the O
only O
ONE O
who O
is O
omniscient O
as O
well O
as O
omnipotent O
. O

It O
is O
evidently O
contrary O
to O
the O
first O
principles O
of O
reason O
, O
that O
supreme O
unlimited O
power O
should O
be O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
one O
man O
. O

It O
is O
the O
greatest O
“ O
idolatry O
, O
begotten O
by O
flattery O
, O
on O
the O
body O
of O
pride O
, O
” O
that O
could O
induce O
one O
to O
think O
that O
a O
single O
mortal O
should O
be O
able O
to O
hold O
so O
great O
a O
power O
, O
if O
ever O
so O
well O
inclined O
. O

Hence O
the O
origin O
of O
deifying O
princes O
: O
It O
was O
from O
the O
trick O
of O
gulling O
the O
vulgar O
into O
a O
belief O
that O
their O
tyrants O
were O
omniscient O
; O
and O
that O
it O
was O
therefore O
right O
, O
that O
they O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
omnipotent O
. O

Hence O
the O
Dii O
majorum O
et O
minorum O
gentium O
; O
the O
great O
, O
the O
monarchical O
, O
the O
little O
, O
Provincial O
subordinate O
and O
subaltern O
gods O
, O
demi-gods O
, O
and O
semidemi-gods O
, O
ancient O
and O
modern O
. O

Thus O
deities O
of O
all O
kinds O
were O
multiplied O
and O
increased O
in O
abundance O
; O
for O
every O
devil O
incarnate O
, O
who O
could O
enslave O
a O
people O
, O
acquired O
a O
title O
to O
divinity O
; O
and O
thus O
the O
“ O
rabble O
of O
the O
skies O
” O
was O
made O
up O
of O
locusts O
and O
catterpillars O
; O
lions O
, O
tygers O
and O
harpies O
; O
and O
other O
devourers O
translated O

4 O
The O
end O
of O
government O
being O
the O
good O
of O
mankind O
, O
points O
out O
its O
great O
duties O
: O
It O
is O
above O
all O
things O
to O
provide O
for O
the O
security O
, O
the O
quiet O
, O
and O
happy O
enjoyment O
of O
life O
, O
liberty O
, O
and O
property O
. O

There O
is O
no O
one O
act O
which O
a O
government O
can O
have O
a O
right O
to O
make O
, O
that O
does O
not O
tend O
to O
the O
advancement O
of O
the O
security O
, O
tranquility O
and O
prosperity O
of O
the O
people O
. O

If O
life O
, O
liberty O
and O
property O
could O
be O
enjoyed O
in O
as O
great O
perfection O
in O
solitude O
, O
as O
in O
society O
, O
there O
would O
be O
no O
need O
of O
government O
. O

But O
the O
experience O
of O
ages O
has O
proved O
that O
such O
is O
the O
nature O
of O
man O
, O
a O
weak O
, O
imperfect O
being O
; O
that O
the O
valuable O
ends O
of O
life O
cannot O
be O
obtained O
, O
without O
the O
union O
and O
assistance O
of O
many O
. O

Hence O
’ O
tis O
clear O
that O
men O
cannot O
live O
apart O
or O
independent O
of O
each O
other O
: O
In O
solitude O
men O
would O
perish O
; O
and O
yet O
they O
cannot O
live O
together O
without O
contests O
. O

These O
contests O
require O
some O
arbitrator O
to O
determine O
them O
. O

The O
necessity O
of O
a O
common O
, O
indifferent O
and O
impartial O
judge O
, O
makes O
all O
men O
seek O
one O
; O
tho O
’ O
few O
find O
him O
in O
the O
sovereign O
power O
, O
of O
their O
respective O
states O
or O
any O
where O
else O
in O
subordination O
to O
it O
. O

Government O
is O
founded O
immediately O
on O
the O
necessities O
of O
human O
nature O
, O
and O
ultimately O
on O
the O
will O
of O
God O
, O
the O
author O
of O
nature O
; O
who O
has O
not O
left O
it O
to O
men O
in O
general O

whether O
they O
will O
be O
members O
of O
society O
or O
not O
, O
but O
at O
the O
hazard O
of O
their O
senses O
if O
not O
of O
their O
lives O
. O

Yet O
it O
is O
left O
to O
every O
man O
as O
he O
comes O
of O
age O
to O
chuse O
what O
society O
he O
will O
continue O
to O
belong O
to O
. O

Nay O
if O
one O
has O
a O
mind O
to O
turn O
Hermit O
, O
and O
after O
he O
has O
been O
born O
, O
nursed O
, O
and O
brought O
up O
in O
the O
arms O
of O
society O
, O
and O
acquired O
the O
habits O
and O
passions O
of O
social O
life O
, O
is O
willing O
to O
run O
the O
risque O
of O
starving O
alone O
, O
which O
is O
generally O
most O
unavoidable O
in O
a O
state O
of O
hermitage O
, O
who O
shall O
hinder O
him O
? O

I O
know O
of O
no O
human O
law O
, O
founded O
on O
the O
law O
of O
nature O
, O
to O
restrain O
him O
from O
separating O
himself O
from O
all O
the O
species O
, O
if O
he O
can O
find O
it O
in O
his O
heart O
to O
leave O
them O
; O
unless O
it O
should O
be O
said O
, O
it O
is O
against O
the O
great O
law O
of O
selfpreservation O
: O
But O
of O
this O
every O
man O
will O
think O
himself O
his O
own O
judge O
. O

The O
few O
Hermits O
and O
Misanthropes O
that O
have O
ever O
existed O
, O
show O
that O
those O
states O
are O
unnatural O
. O

If O
we O
were O
to O
take O
out O
from O
them O
, O
those O
who O
have O
made O
great O
worldly O
gain O
of O
their O
godly O
hermitage O
, O
and O
those O
who O
have O
been O
under O
the O
madness O
of O
enthusiasm O
, O
or O
disappointed O
hopes O
in O
their O
ambitious O
projects O
, O
for O
the O
detriment O
of O
mankind O
; O
perhaps O
there O
might O
not O
be O
left O
ten O
from O
Adam B-Person
to O
this O
day O
. O

The O
form O
of O
government O
is O
by O
nature O
and O
by O
right O
so O
far O
left O
to O
the O
individuals O
of O
each O
society O
, O
that O
they O
may O
alter O
it O
from O
a O
simple O
democracy O
or O
government O
of O
all O
over O
all O
, O
to O
any O
other O
form O
they O
please O
. O

Such O
alteration O
may O
and O
ought O
to O
be O
made O
by O
express O
compact O
: O
But O
how O
seldom O
this O
right O
has O
been O
asserted O
, O
history O
will O
abundantly O
show O
. O

For O
once O
that O
it O
has O
been O
fairly O
settled O
by O
compact O
; O
fraud O
, O
force O
or O
accident O
have O
determined O
it O
an O
hundred O
times O
. O

As O
the O
people O
have O
gained O
upon O
tyrants O
, O
these O
have O
been O
obliged O
to O
relax O
, O
only O
till O
a O
fairer O
opportunity O
has O
put O
it O
in O
their O
power O
to O
encroach O
again O
. O

But O
if O
every O
prince O
since O
Nimrod B-Person
had O
been O
a O
tyrant O
, O
it O
would O
not O
prove O
a O
right O
to O
tyranize O
. O

There O
can O
be O
no O
prescription O
old O
enough O
to O
supersede O
the O
law O
of O
nature O
, O
and O
the O
grant O
of O
GOD O
almighty O
; O
who O
has O
given O
to O
all O
men O
a O
natural O
right O
to O
be O
free O
, O
and O
they O
have O
it O
ordinarily O
in O
their O
power O
to O
make O
themselves O
so O
, O
if O
they O
please O
. O

Government O
having O
been O
proved O
to O
be O
necessary O
by O
the O
law O
of O
nature O
, O
it O
makes O
no O
difference O
in O
the O
thing O
to O
call O
it O
from O
a O
certain O
period O
, O
civil O
. O

This O
term O
can O
only O
relate O
to O
form O
, O
to O
additions O
to O
, O
or O
deviations O
from O
, O
the O
substance O
of O
government O
: O
This O
being O
founded O
in O
nature O
, O
the O
superstructures O
and O
the O
whole O
administration O
should O
be O
conformed O
to O
the O
law O
of O
universal O
reason O
. O

A O
supreme O
legislative O
and O
a O
supreme O
executive O
power O
, O
must O
be O
placed O
somewhere O
in O
every O
common-wealth O
: O
Where O
there O
is O
no O
other O
positive O
provision O
or O
compact O
to O
the O
contrary O
, O
those O
powers O
remain O
in O
the O
whole O
body O
of O
the O
people O
. O

It O
is O
also O
evident O
there O
can O
be O
but O
one O
best O
way O
of O
depositing O
those O
powers O
; O
but O
what O
that O
way O
is O
, O
mankind O
have O
been O
disputing O
in O
peace O
and O
in O
war O
more O
than O
five O
thousand O
years O
. O

If O
we O
could O
suppose O
the O
individuals O
of O
a O
community O
met O
to O
deliberate O
, O
whether O
it O
were O
best O
to O
keep O
those O
powers O
in O
their O
own O
hands O
, O
or O
dispose O
of O
them O
in O
trust O
, O
the O
following O
questions O
would O
occur—Whether O
those O
two O
great O
powers O
of O
Legislation O
and O
Execution O
should O
remain O
united O
? O

If O
so O
, O
whether O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
many O
, O
or O
jointly O
or O
severally O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
a O
few O
, O
or O
jointly O
in O
some O
one O
individual O
? O

If O
both O
those O
powers O
are O
retained O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
many O
, O
where O
nature O
seems O
to O
have O
placed O
them O
originally O
, O
the O
government O
is O
a O
simple O
democracy O
, O
or O
a O
government O
of O
all O
over O
all O
. O

This O
can O
be O
administred O
, O
only O
by O
establishing O
it O
as O
a O
first O
principle O
, O
that O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
majority O
shall O
be O
taken O
as O
the O
voice O
of O
the O
whole O
. O

If O
those O
powers O
are O
lodged O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
a O
few O
, O
the O
government O
is O
an O
Aristocracy O
or O
Oligarchy O
.5 O
Here O
too O
the O
first O
principles O
of O
a O
practicable O
administration O
is O
that O
the O
majority O
rules O
the O
whole O
. O

If O
those O
great O
powers O
are O
both O
lodged O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
one O
man O
, O
the O
government O
is O
a O
simple O
Monarchy O
, O
commonly O
, O
though O
falsly O
called O
absolute O
, O
if O
by O
that O
term O
is O
meant O
a O
right O
to O
do O
as O
one O
pleases O
. O

— O
Sic O
volo O

, O
stet O
pro O
ratione O

, O
belongs O
not O
of O
right O
to O
any O
mortal O
man O

The O
same O
law O
of O
nature O
and O
of O
reason O
is O
equally O
obligatory O
on O
a O
democracy O
, O
an O
aristocracy O
, O
and O
a O
monarchy O
: O
Whenever O
the O
administrators O
, O
in O
any O
of O
those O
forms O
, O
deviate O
from O
truth O
, O
justice O
and O
equity O
, O
they O
verge O
towards O
tyranny O
, O
and O
are O
to O
be O
opposed O
; O
and O
if O
they O
prove O
incorrigible O
, O
they O
will O
be O
deposed O
by O
the O
people O
, O
if O
the O
people O
are O
not O
rendered O
too O
abject O
. O

Deposing O
the O
administrators O
of O
a O
simple O
democracy O
may O
sound O
oddly O
, O
but O
it O
is O
done O
every O
day O
, O
and O
in O
almost O
every O
vote O
. O

A O
. O

B O
. O
& O
C O
. O
for O
example O
, O
make O
a O
democracy O
. O

To O
day O
A O
& O
B O
are O
for O
so O
vile O
a O
measure O
as O
a O
standing O
army O
. O

To O
morrow O
B O
& O
C O
vote O
it O
out O
. O

This O
is O
as O
really O
deposing O
the O
former O
administrators O
, O
as O
setting O
up O
and O
making O
a O
new O
king O
is O
deposing O
the O
old O
one O
. O

Democracy O
in O
the O
one O
case O
, O
and O
monarchy O
in O
the O
other O
, O
still O
remain O
; O
all O
that O
is O
done O
is O
to O
change O
the O
administration O
. O

The O
first O
principle O
and O
great O
end O
of O
government O
being O
to O
provide O
for O
the O
best O
good O
of O
all O
the O
people O
, O
this O
can O
be O
done O
only O
by O
a O
supreme O
legislative O
and O
executive O
ultimately O
in O
the O
people O
, O
or O
whole O
community O
, O
where O
GOD O
has O
placed O
it O
; O
but O
the O
inconveniencies O
, O
not O
to O
say O
impossibility O
, O
attending O
the O
consultations O
and O
operations O
of O
a O
large O
body O
of O
people O
, O
have O
made O
it O
necessary O
to O
transfer O
the O
power O
of O
the O
whole O
to O
a O
few O
: O
This O
necessity O
gave O
rise O
to O
deputation O
, O
proxy O
or O
a O
right O
of O
representation O
. O

A O
Power O
of O
legislation O
, O
without O
a O
power O
of O
execution O
in O
the O
same O
or O
other O
hands O
, O
would O
be O
futile O
and O
vain O
: O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
a O
power O
of O
execution O
, O
supreme O
or O
subordinate O
, O
without O
an O
independent O
legislature O
, O
would O
be O
perfect O
despotism O
. O

The O
difficulties O
attending O
an O
universal O
congress O
, O
especially O
when O
society O
became O
large O
, O
have O
bro O
’ O
t O
men O
to O
consent O
to O
a O
delegation O
of O
the O
power O
of O
all O
: O
The O
weak O
and O
the O
wicked O
have O
too O
often O
been O
found O
in O
the O
same O
interest O
, O
and O
in O
most O
nations O
have O
not O
only O
bro O
’ O
t O
these O
powers O
jointly O
, O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
one O
, O
or O
some O
few O
, O
of O
their O
number O
; O
but O
made O
them O
hereditary O
, O
in O
the O
families O
of O
despotic O
nobles O
& O
princes O
. O

The O
wiser O
and O
more O
virtuous O
states O
, O
have O
always O
provided O
that O
the O
representation O
of O
the O
people O
should O
be O
numerous O
. O

Nothing O
but O
life O
and O
liberty O
are O
naturally O
hereditable O
: O
this O
has O
never O
been O
considered O
by O
those O
, O
who O
have O
tamely O
given O
up O
both O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
a O
tyrannical O
Oligarchy O
or O
despotic O
Monarchy O
. O

The O
analogy O
between O
the O
natural O
, O
or O
material O
, O
as O
it O
is O
called O
, O
and O
the O
moral O
world O
is O
very O
obvious O
; O
GOD O
himself O
appears O
to O
us O
at O
some O
times O
to O
cause O
the O
intervention O
or O
combination O
of O
a O
number O
of O
simple O
principles O
, O
tho O
’ O
never O
when O
one O
will O
answer O
the O
end O
; O
gravitation O
and O
attraction O
have O
place O
in O
the O
revolution O
of O
the O
planets O
, O
because O
the O
one O
would O
fix O
them O
to O
a O
centre O
, O
and O
the O
other O
would O
carry O
them O
off O
indefinitely O
; O
so O
in O
the O
moral O
world O
, O
the O
first O
simple O
principle O
is O
equality O
and O
the O
power O
of O
the O
whole O
. O

This O
will O
answer O
in O
small O
numbers O
; O
so O
will O
a O
tolerably O
virtuous O
Oligarchy O
or O
a O
Monarchy O
. O

But O
when O
the O
society O
grows O
in O
bulk O
, O
none O
of O
them O
will O
answer O
well O
singly O
, O
and O
none O
worse O
than O
absolute O
monarchy O
. O

It O
becomes O
necessary O
therefore O
as O
numbers O
increase O
, O
to O
have O
those O
several O
powers O
properly O
combined O
; O
so O
as O
from O
the O
whole O
to O
produce O
that O
harmony O
of O
government O
so O
often O
talked O
of O
and O
wished O
for O
, O
but O
too O
seldom O
found O
in O
ancient O
or O
modern O
states O
. O

The O
grand O
political O
problem O
in O
all O
ages O
has O
been O
to O
invent O
the O
best O
combination O
or O
distribution O
of O
the O
supreme O
powers O
of O
legislation O
and O
execution O
. O

Those O
states O
have O
ever O
made O
the O
greatest O
figure O
, O
and O
have O
been O
most O
durable O
, O
in O
which O
those O
powers O
have O
not O
only O
been O
separated O
from O
each O
other O
, O
but O
placed O
each O
in O
more O
hands O
than O
one O
, O
or O
a O
few O
. O

The O
Romans O
are O
the O
most O
shining O
example O
; O
but O
they O
never O
had O
a O
balance O
between O
the O
senate B-Organization
and O
the O
people O
, O
and O
the O
want O
of O
this O
, O
is O
generally O
agreed O
by O
the O
few O
who O
know O
any O
thing O
of O
the O
matter O
, O
to O
have O
been O
the O
cause O
of O
their O
fall O
. O

The O
British O
constitution O
in O
theory O
and O
in O
the O
present O
administration B-Organization
of O
it O
, O
in O
general O
comes O
nearest O
the O
idea O
of O
perfection O
, O
of O
any O
that O
has O
been O
reduced O
to O
practice O
; O
and O
if O
the O
principles O
of O
it O
are O
adhered O
to O
, O
it O
will O
according O
to O
the O
infallible O
prediction O
of O
Harrington B-Person
, O
always O
keep O
the O
Britons O
uppermost O
in O
Europe B-Location
, O
’ O
till O
their O
only O
rival O
nation O
shall O
either O
embrace O
that O
perfect O
model O
of O
a O
common O
wealth O

by O
that O
author B-Person
, O
or O
come O
as O
near O

as O
Great B-Organization
Britain I-Organization
is O
. O

Then O
indeed O
and O
not O
till O
then O
, O
will O
that O
rival O
& O
our O
nation B-Organization
either O
be O
eternal O
confederates O
, O
or O
contend O
in O
greater O
earnest O
than O
they O
have O
ever O
yet O
done O
, O
till O
one O
of O
them O
shall O
sink O
under O
the O
power O
of O
the O
other O
, O
and O
rise O
no O
more O

Great B-Organization
Britain I-Organization
has O
at O
present O
, O
most O
evidently O
the O
advantage O
, O
and O
such O
opportunities O
of O
honest O
wealth O
and O
grandeur O
, O
as O
perhaps O
no O
state O
ever O
had O
before O
, O
at O

not O
since O
the O
days O
of O
Julius B-Person
Cæsar I-Person
, O
the O
destroyer O
of O
the O
roman O
glory O
and O
grandeur O
; O
at O
a O
time O
when O
but O
for O
him O
and O
his O
adherents O
both O
might O
have O
been O
rendered O
immortal O
. O

We O
have O
said O
that O
the O
form O
and O
mode O
of O
government O
is O
to O
be O
settled O
by O
compact O
, O
as O
it O
was O
rightfully O
done O
by O
the O
convention O
after O
the O
abdication O
of O
James B-Person
II I-Person
, O
and O
assented O
to O
by O
the O
first O
representative O
of O
the O
nation B-Organization
chosen O
afterwards O

by O
every O
parliament B-Organization

by O
almost O
every O

the O
bigots O

to O
the O
indefeasible O
power O
of O
tyrants O

There O
was O
neither O
time O
for O

nor O
occasion O
to O
call O
the O
whole O
people O
together O
: O
If O
they O

the O
supreme B-Organization

“ O
Tho O
’ O
, O
says O
he O
, O
in O
a O
constituted O
common O
wealth O
, O
standing O
upon O
its O
own O
basis O
, O
and O
acting O
according O
to O
its O
own O
nature O
, O
that O
is O
, O
acting O
for O
the O
preservation O
of O
the O
community O
, O
there O
can O
be O
but O
one O
supreme O
power O
which O
is O
the O
legislative O
, O
to O
which O
all O
the O
rest O
are O
and O
must O
be O
subordinate O
; O
yet O
the O
legislative O
being O
only O
a O
fiduciary O
power O
, O
to O
act O
for O
certain O
ends O
, O
there O
remains O
still O
, O
“ O
in O
the O
people O
, O
a O
supreme O
power O
to O
remove O
, O
or O
alter O
, O
the O
legislative O
when O
they O
find O
the O
legislative O
act O
contrary O
to O
the O
trust O
reposed O
in O
them O
. O
” O

For O
all O
power O
given O
, O
with O
trust O
for O
the O
attaining O
an O
end O
, O
being O
limited O
by O
that O
end O
, O
whenever O
that O
end O
is O
manifestly O
neglected O
, O
or O
opposed O
, O
the O
trust O
must O
necessarily O
be O
forfeited O
, O
and O
the O
power O
devolve O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
those O
who O
gave O
it O
, O
who O
may O
place O
it O
anew O
where O
they O
shall O
think O
best O
, O
for O
their O
safety O
and O
security O
. O

And O
thus O
the O
community O
perpetually O
retains O
a O
supreme O
power O
of O
saving O
themselves O
from O
the O
attempts O
and O
designs O
of O
any O
body O
, O
even O
of O
their O
legislators O
whenever O
they O
shall O
be O
so O
foolish O
, O
or O
so O
wicked O
, O
as O
to O
lay O
and O
carry O
on O
designs O
against O
the O
liberties O
and O
properties O
of O
the O
subject O
. O

For O
no O
man O
or O
society O
of O
men O
having O
a O
power O
to O
deliver O
up O
their O
preservation O
or O
consequently O
the O
means O
of O
it O
to O
the O
absolute O
will O
and O
arbitrary O
dominion O
of O
another O
; O
whenever O
any O
one O
shall O
go O
about O
to O
bring O
them O
into O
such O
a O
slavish O
condition O
, O
they O
will O
always O
have O
a O
right O
to O
preserve O
what O
they O
have O
not O
a O
power O
to O
part O
with O
; O
and O
to O
rid O
themselves O
of O
those O
who O
invade O
this O
fundamental O
, O
sacred O
and O
unalterable O
law O
of O
self O
preservation O
, O
for O
which O
they O
entered O
into O
society O
. O

And O
thus O
the O
community O
may O
be O
said O
in O
this O
respect O
to O
be O
always O
the O
supreme O
power O
, O
but O
not O
as O
considered O
under O
any O
form O
of O
government O
, O
because O
this O
power O
of O

can O

great O
an O

as O
Dr B-Person

Strahan I-Person
, O
tis O
humbly O
hoped O
that O
the O
British O

do O
not O
hold O
their O

as O
well O
as O

by O
so O
slippery O
a O

as O
do O
the O
Spaniards O

. O

The O
will O
of O
the O
Prince B-Organization
is O
the O
only O
tenure O
by O
which O
they O
hold O
; O
and O
the O
government B-Organization
of I-Organization
the I-Organization
Spanish I-Organization
and O
French B-Organization
settlements I-Organization
is O
in O
every O
respect O
despotic O
. O
’ O
Tis O
well O
known O
that O
the O
first O
American O
grants O
were O
by O
the O
Bulls O
of O
the O
Popes B-Organization
. O

The O
Roman B-Organization
Pontiffs I-Organization
had O
for O
ages O
usurped O
the O
most O
abominable O
power O
over O
princes B-Organization
: O
They O
granted O
away O
the O
kingdoms B-Location
of O
the O
earth O
with O
as O
little O
ceremony O
as O
a O

would O
lease O

Now O
according O
to O
Dr B-Person
. I-Person
Strahans I-Person
’ O
s O
logic O
, O
it O
may O
be O
inferred O
, O
that O
the O
canon O
law O
, O
and O
the O
Popes B-Organization
Bulls O
, O
must O
be O
of O
service O
likewise O
, O
for O

any O

that O
may O

touching O
the O
duties O
or O

of O
the O

in O
the O
British B-Location
colonies I-Location
. O

And O
indeed O
it O
must O
be O
owned O
, O
if O
we O
were O
to O
judge O
of O
some O
late O
proceedings9 O
by O
this O
rule O
, O
we O
must O
allow O
that O
they O
savor O
more O
of O
modern O
Rome O
and O
the O
Inquisition O
, O
than O
of O
the O
common O
law O
of O
England B-Organization
and O
the O
constitution O
of O
Great-Britain B-Organization
. O

In O
order O
to O
form O
an O
idea O
of O
the O
natural O
rights O
of O
the O
Colonists O
, O
I O
presume O
it O
will O
be O
granted O
that O
they O
are O
men O
, O
the O
common O
children O
of O
the O
same O
Creator O
with O
their O
brethren O
of O
Great-Britain B-Organization
. O

Nature O
has O
placed O
all O
such O
in O
a O
state O
of O
equality O
and O
perfect O
freedom O
, O
to O
act O
within O
the O
bounds O
of O
the O
laws O
of O
nature O
and O
reason O
, O
without O
consulting O
the O
will O
or O
regarding O
the O
humor O
, O
the O
passions O
or O
whims O
of O
any O
other O
man O
, O
unless O
they O
are O
formed O
into O
a O
society O
or O
body O
politic O
. O

This O
it O
must O
be O
confessed O
is O
rather O
an O
abstract O
way O
of O
considering O
men O
than O
agreeable O
to O
the O
real O
and O
general O
course O
of O
nature O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
as O
has O
been O
shown O
, O
men O
come O
into O
the O
world O
and O
into O
society O
at O
the O
same O
instant O
. O

But O
this O
hinders O
not O
but O
that O
the O
natural O
and O
original O
rights O
of O
each O
individual O
may O
be O
illustrated O
and O
explained O
in O
this O
way O
better O
than O
in O
any O
other O
. O

We O
see O
here O
by O
the O
way O
a O
probability O
, O
that O
this O
abstract O
consideration O
of O
men O
, O
which O
has O
its O
use O
in O
reasoning O
on O
the O
principles O
of O
government O
, O
has O
insensibly O
led O
some O
of O
the O
greatest O
men O
to O
imagine O
, O
some O
real O
general O
state O
of O
nature O
, O
agreeable O
to O
this O
abstract O
conception O
, O
antecedent O
to O
and O
independent O
of O
society O
. O

This O
is O
certainly O
not O
the O
case O
in O
general O
, O
for O
most O
men O
become O
members O
of O
society O
from O
their O
birth O
, O
tho O
’ O
seperate O
independent O
states O
are O
really O
in O
the O
condition O
of O
perfect O
freedom O
and O
equality O
with O
regard O
to O
each O
other O
; O
and O
so O
are O
any O
number O
of O
individuals O
who O
separate O
themselves O
from O
a O
society O
of O
which O
they O
have O
formerly O
been O
members O
, O
for O
ill O
treatment O
, O
or O
other O
good O
cause O
, O
with O
express O
design O
to O
found O
another O
. O

If O
in O
such O
case O
, O
there O
is O
a O
real O
interval O
, O
between O
the O
separation O
and O
the O
new O
conjunction O
, O
during O
such O
interval O
, O
the O
individuals O
are O
as O
much O
detached O
, O
and O
under O
the O
law O
of O
nature O
only O
, O
as O
would O
be O
two O
men O
who O
should O
chance O
to O
meet O
on O
a O
desolate O
island O
. O

The O
Colonists O
are O
by O
the O
law O
of O
nature O
free O
born O
, O
as O
indeed O
all O
men O
are O
, O
white O
or O
black O
. O

No O
better O
reasons O
can O
be O
given O
, O
for O
enslaving O
those O
of O
any O
color O
than O
such O
as O
baron B-Person
Montesquieu I-Person
has O
humorously O
given O
, O
as O
the O
foundation O
of O
that O
cruel O
slavery O
exercised O
over O
the O
poor O
Ethiopians O
; O
which O
threatens O
one O

to O
reduce O
both O
Europe B-Location
and O
America B-Location
to O
the O
ignorance O
and O
barbarity O
of O
the O
darkest O
ages O
. O

Does O
it O
follow O
that O
tis O
right O
to O
enslave O
a O
man O
because O
he O
is O
black O
? O

Will O
short O
curl O
’ O
d O
hair O
like O
wool O
, O
instead O
of O
christian O
hair O
, O
as O
tis O
called O

those O
, O
whose O
hearts O
, O
are O
as O
hard O
as O
the O

help O
the O
argument O
? O

Can O
any O

of O
slavery O
, O
be O
drawn O
from O
a O
flat O

, O
a O

There O
are O

back O

that O
they O

imagine O
themselves O

indeed O

see O

such O

does O

Their O

Their O

hold O

the O

— O
I O
also O
lay O
it O
down O
as O
one O
of O
the O
first O
principles O
from O
whence O
I O
intend O
to O
deduce O
the O
civil O
rights O
of O
the O
British B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
, O
that O
all O
of O
them O
are O
subject O
to O
, O
and O
dependent O
on O
Great-Britain B-Organization
; O
and O
that O
therefore O
as O
over O
subordinate O
governments O
, O
the O
parliament B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great-Britain I-Organization
has O
an O
undoubted O
power O
and O
lawful O
authority O
to O
make O
acts O
for O
the O
general O
good O
, O
that O
by O
naming O
them O
, O
shall O
and O
ought O
to O
be O
equally O
binding O
, O
as O
upon O
the O
subjects O
of O
Great-Britain B-Organization
within O
the O
realm O
. O

This O
principle O
, O
I O
presume O
will O
be O
readily O
granted O
on O
the O
other O
side O
the O
atlantic O

It O
has O
been O
practiced O
upon O
for O
twenty O
years O
to O
my O
knowledge O
, O
in O
the O
province B-Location
of I-Location
the I-Location
Massachusetts-Bay I-Location
; O
and O
I O
have O
ever O
received O
it O
, O
that O
it O
has O
been O
so O
from O
the O
beginning O
, O
in O
this O
and O
the O
sister O
provinces B-Location
, O
thro O
’ O
the O
continent B-Location
.11 O
I O
am O
aware O
, O
some O
will O
think O
it O
is O
time O
for O
me O
to O
retreat O
, O
after O
having O
expressed O
the O
power O
of O
the O
British B-Organization
parliament I-Organization
in O
quite O
so O
strong O
terms O
. O

But O
’ O
tis O
from O
and O
under O
this O
very O
power O
and O
its O
acts O
, O
and O
from O
the O
common O
law O
, O
that O
the O
political O
and O
civil O
rights O
of O
the O
Colonists O
are O
derived O
: O
And O
upon O
those O
grand O
pillars O
of O
liberty O
shall O
my O
defence O
be O
rested O
. O

At O
present O
therefore O
, O
the O
reader O
may O
suppose O
, O
that O
there O
is O
not O
one O
provincial O
charter O
on O
the O
continent B-Location
; O
he O
may O
, O
if O
he O
pleases O
, O
imagine O
all O
taken O
away O

without O
fault O

without O
forfeiture O
, O
without O
tryal O
or O
notice O

All O
this O
really O
happened O
to O
some O
of O
them O
in O
the O
last O
century O
. O

I O
would O
have O
the O
reader O
carry O
his O
imagination O
still O
further O
, O
and O
suppose O
a O
time O
may O
come O
, O
when O
instead O
of O
a O
process O
at O
common O
law O
, O
the O
parliament B-Organization
shall O
give O
a O
decisive O
blow O
to O
every O
charter O
in O
America B-Location
, O
and O
declare O
them O
all O
void O
. O

Nay O
it O
shall O
also O
be O
granted O
, O
that O
’ O
tis O
barely O
possible O
, O
the O
time O
may O
come O
, O
when O
the O
real O
interest O
of O
the O
whole O
may O
require O
an O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
to O
annihilate O
all O
those O
charters O
. O

What O
could O
follow O
from O
all O
this O
, O
that O
would O
shake O
one O
of O
the O
essential O
, O
natural O
, O
civil O
or O
religious O
rights O
of O
the O
Colonists O
? O

Nothing O
. O

They O
would O
be O
men O
, O
citizens O
and O
british O
subjects O
after O
all O
. O

No O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
can O
deprive O
them O
of O
the O
liberties O
of O
such O
, O
unless O
any O
will O
contend O
that O
an O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
can O
make O
slaves O
not O
only O
of O
one O
, O
but O
of O
two O
millions O
of O
the O
commonwealth B-Organization
. O

And O
if O
so O
, O
why O
not O
of O
the O
whole O
? O

I O
freely O
own O
, O
that O
I O
can O
find O
nothing O
in O
the O
laws O
of O
my O
country B-Organization
, O
that O
would O
justify O
the O
parliament B-Organization
in O
making O
one O
slave O
, O
nor O
did O
they O
ever O
professedly O
undertake O
to O
make O
one O

Two O
or O
three O
innocent O
colony O
charters O
have O
been O
threatened O
with O
destruction O
an O
hundred O

forty O
years O
past O

I O
wish O
the O
present O
enemies O
of O

would O
reflect O
a O
moment O
, O
and O
be O
convinced O
that O
an O
act O
of O

that O
should O
demolish O
those O
bugbears O
to O
the O
foes O

not O

As O
it O
is O
agreed O
on O
all O

the O

I O
can O
see O

the O

as O

as O
men O
. O

I O
say O
men O
, O
for O
in O
a O
state O
of O
nature O
, O
no O
man O
can O
take O
my O
property O
from O

without O
my O

: O
If O
he O
does O
, O
he O
deprives O
me O
of O
my O
liberty O

makes O
me O
a O

If O
such O
a O
proceeding O
is O
a O
breach O
of O
the O
law O
of O
nature O
, O
no O
law O
of O
society O
can O
make O
it O
just—The O
very O
act O
of O
taxing O
, O
exercised O
over O
those O
who O
are O

appears O
to O
me O
to O
be O
depriving O
them O
of O
one O
of O
their O
most O
essential O

as O
freemen O

if O
continued O

seems O
to O
be O
in O

an O

I O
think O
I O
have O
heard O
it O
said O
, O
that O
when O
the O
Dutch O
are O
asked O
why O
they O
enslave O
their O
colonies B-Organization
, O
their O
answer O
is O
, O
that O
the O
liberty O
of O
Dutchmen O
is O
confined O
to O
Holland B-Location
; O
and O
that O
it O
was O
never O
intended O
for O
Provincials O
in O
America B-Location
, O
or O
any O
where O
else O
. O

A O
sentiment O
this O
, O
very O
worthy O
of O
modern O
Dutchmen O
; O
but O
if O
their O
brave O
and O
worthy O
ancestors O
had O
entertained O
such O
narrow O
ideas O
of O
liberty O
, O
seven O
poor O
and O
distressed O
provinces B-Organization
would O
never O
have O
asserted O
their O
rights O
against O
the O
whole O
Spanish B-Organization
monarchy I-Organization
, O
of O
which O
the O
present O
is O
but O
a O
shadow O
. O

It O
is O
to O
be O
hoped O
, O
none O
of O
our O
fellow O
subjects O
of O
Britain B-Organization
, O
great O
or O
small O
, O
have O
borrowed O
this O
Dutch O
maxim O
of O
plantation O
politics O
; O
if O
they O
have O
, O
they O
had O
better O
return O
it O
from O
whence O
it O
came O
; O
indeed O
they O
had O
. O

Modern O
Dutch O
or O
French O
maxims O
of O
state O
, O
never O
will O
suit O
with O
a O
British O
constitution O
. O

It O
is O
a O
maxim O
, O
that O
the O
King B-Organization
can O
do O
no O
wrong O
; O
and O
every O
good O
subject O
is O
bound O
to O
believe O
his O
King B-Organization
is O
not O
inclined O
to O
do O
any O
. O

We O
are O
blessed O
with O
a O
prince B-Person
who O
has O
given O
abundant O
demonstrations O
, O
that O
in O
all O
his O
actions O
, O
he O
studies O
the O
good O
of O
his O
people O
, O
and O
the O
true O
glory O
of O
his O
crown B-Organization
, O
which O
are O
inseparable O
. O

It O
would O
therefore O
, O
be O
the O
highest O
degree O
of O
impudence O
and O
disloyalty O
to O
imagine O
that O
the O
King B-Organization
, O
at O
the O
head O
of O
his O
parliament B-Organization
, O
could O
have O
any O
, O
but O
the O
most O
pure O
and O
perfect O
intentions O
of O
justice O
, O
goodness O
and O
truth O
, O
that O
human O
nature O
is O
capable O
of O
. O

All O
this O
I O
say O
and O
believe O
of O
the O
King B-Organization
and O
parliament B-Organization
, O
in O
all O
their O
acts O
; O
even O
in O
that O
which O
so O
nearly O
affects O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
colonists O
; O
and O
that O
a O
most O
perfect O
and O
ready O
obedience O
is O
to O
be O
yielded O
to O
it O
, O
while O
it O
remains O
in O
force O
. O

I O
will O
go O
further O
, O
and O
readily O
admit O
, O
that O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
ministry B-Organization
was O
not O
only O
to O
promote O
the O
public O
good O
, O
by O
this O
act O
; O
but O
that O
Mr B-Person
. I-Person
Chancellor I-Person
of I-Person
the I-Person
Exchequer I-Person
had O
therein O
a O
particular O
view O
to O
the O
“ O
ease O
, O
the O
quiet O
, O
and O
the O
good O
will O
of O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
, O
” O
he O
having O
made O
this O
declaration O
more O
than O
once O
. O

Yet O
I O
hold O
that O
’ O
tis O
possible O
he O
may O
have O
erred O
in O
his O
kind O
intentions O
towards O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
, O
and O
taken O
away O
our O
fish O
, O
and O
given O
us O
a O
stone O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
parliament B-Organization
, O
as O
infallability O
belongs O
not O
to O
mortals O
, O
’ O
tis O
possible O
they O
may O
have O
been O
misinformed O
and O
deceived O
. O

The O
power O
of O
parliament B-Organization
is O
uncontroulable O
, O
but O
by O
themselves O
, O
and O
we O
must O
obey O
. O

They O
only O
can O
repeal O
their O
own O
acts O
. O

There O
would O
be O
an O
end O
of O
all O
government O
, O
if O
one O
or O
a O
number O
of O
subjects O
or O
subordinate O
provinces O
should O
take O
upon O
them O
so O
far O
to O
judge O
of O
the O
justice O
of O
an O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
, O
as O
to O
refuse O
obedience O
to O
it O
. O

If O
there O
was O
nothing O
else O
to O
restrain O
such O
a O
step O
, O
prudence O
ought O
to O
do O
it O
, O
for O
forceably O
resisting O
the O
parliament B-Organization
and O
the O
King B-Organization
’ O
s O
laws O
, O
is O
high O
treason O
. O

Therefore O
let O
the O
parliament B-Organization
lay O
what O
burthens O
they O
please O
on O
us O
, O
we O
must O
, O
it O
is O
our O
duty O
to O
submit O
and O
patiently O
bear O
them O
, O
till O
they O
will O
be O
pleased O
to O
relieve O
us O
. O

And O
tis O
to O
be O
presumed O
, O
the O
wisdom O
and O
justice O
of O
that O
august B-Organization
assembly I-Organization
, O
always O
will O
afford O
us O
relief O
by O
repealing O
such O
acts O
, O
as O
through O
mistake O
, O
or O
other O
human O
infirmities O
, O
have O
been O
suffered O
to O
pass O
, O
if O
they O
can O
be O
convinced O
that O
their O
proceedings O
are O
not O
constitutional O
, O
or O
not O
for O
the O
common O
good O
. O

The O
parliament B-Organization
may O
be O
deceived O
, O
they O
may O
have O
been O
misinformed O
of O
facts O
, O
and O
the O
colonies B-Organization
may O
in O
many O
respects O
be O
misrepresented O
to O
the O
King B-Organization
, O
his O
parliament B-Organization
, O
and O
his O
ministry B-Organization
. O

In O
some O
instances O
, O
I O
am O
well O
assured O
the O
colonies B-Organization
have O
been O
very O
strangely O
misrepresented O
in O
England B-Location
. O

I O
have O
now O
before O
me O
a O
pamphlet O
, O
called O
the O
“ O
administration O
of O
the O
colonies B-Location
, O
” O
said O
to O
be O
written O
by O
a O
gentleman O
who O
formerly O
commanded O
in O
chief O
in O
one O
of O
them O
. O

I O
suppose O
this O
book O
was O
designed O
for O
public O
information O
and O
use O
. O

There O
are O
in O
it O
many O
good O
regulations O
proposed O
, O
which O
no O
power O
can O
enforce O
but O
the O
parliament B-Organization
. O

From O
all O
which O
I O
infer O
, O
that O
if O
our O
hands O
are O
tied O
by O
the O
passing O
of O
an O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
, O
our O
mouths O
are O
not O
stoped O
, O
provided O
we O
speak O
of O
that O
transcendent O
body O
with O
decency O
, O
as O
I O
have O
endeavoured O
always O
to O
do O
; O
and O
should O
any O
thing O
have O
escaped O
me O
, O
or O
hereafter O
fall O
from O
my O
pen O
, O
that O
bears O
the O
least O
aspect O
but O
that O
of O
obedience O
, O
duty O
and O
loyalty O
to O
the O
King B-Organization
& O
parliament B-Organization
, O
and O
the O
highest O
respect O
for O
the O
ministry B-Organization
, O
the O
candid O
will O
impute O
it O
to O
the O
agony O
of O
my O
heart O
, O
rather O
than O
to O
the O
pravity O
of O
my O
will O
. O

If O
I O
have O
one O
ambitious O
wish O
, O
’ O
tis O
to O
see O
Great-Britain B-Organization
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
to O
see O
my O
King B-Organization
, O
under O
God O
, O
the O
father O
of O
mankind O
. O

I O
pretend O
neither O
to O
the O
spirit O
of O
prophecy O
, O
nor O
any O
uncommon O
skill O
in O
predicting O
a O
Crisis O
, O
much O
less O
to O
tell O
when O
it O
begins O
to O
be O
“ O
nascent O
” O
or O
is O
fairly O
midwiv O
’ O
d O
into O
the O
world O
. O

But O
if O
I O
were O
to O
fix O
a O
meaning O
to O
the O
two O
first O
paragraphs O
of O
the O
administration O
of O
the O
colonies B-Location
, O
tho O
’ O
I O
do O
not O
collect O
it O
from O
them O
, O
I O
should O
say O
the O
world O
was O
at O
the O
eve O
of O
the O
highest O
scene O
of O
earthly O
power O
and O
grandeur O
that O
has O
been O
ever O
yet O
displayed O
to O
the O
view O
of O
mankind O
. O

The O
cards O
are O
shuffling O
fast O
thro O
’ O
all O
Europe B-Location
. O

Who O
will O
win O
the O
prize O
is O
with O
God O
. O

This O
however O
I O
know O
, O
detur O
digniori O
. O

The O
next O
universal O
monarchy O
will O
be O
favourable O
to O
the O
human O
race O
, O
for O
it O
must O
be O
founded O
on O
the O
principles O
of O
equity O
, O
moderation O
and O
justice O
. O

No O
country O
has O
been O
more O
distinguished O
for O
these O
principles O
than O
Great-Britain B-Organization
, O
since O
the O
revolution O
. O

I O
take O
it O
, O
every O
subject O
has O
a O
right O
to O
give O
his O
sentiments O
to O
the O
public O
, O
of O
the O
utility O
or O
inutility O
of O
any O
act O
whatsoever O
, O
even O
after O
it O
is O
passed O
, O
as O
well O
as O
while O
it O
is O
pending O
. O

— O
The O
equity O
and O
justice O
of O
a O
bill O
may O
be O
questioned O
, O
with O
perfect O
submission O
to O
the O
legislature B-Organization
. O

Reasons O
may O
be O
given O
, O
why O
an O
act O
ought O
to O
be O
repeal O
’ O
d O
, O
& O
yet O
obedience O
must O
be O
yielded O
to O
it O
till O
that O
repeal O
takes O
place O
. O

If O
the O
reasons O
that O
can O
be O
given O
against O
an O
act O
, O
are O
such O
as O
plainly O
demonstrate O
that O
it O
is O
against O
natural O
equity O
, O
the O
executive B-Organization
courts I-Organization
will O
adjudge O
such O
act O
void O
. O

It O
may O
be O
questioned O
by O
some O
, O
tho O
’ O
I O
make O
no O
doubt O
of O
it O
, O
whether O
they O
are O
not O
obliged O
by O
their O
oaths O
to O
adjudge O
such O
act O
void O
. O

If O
there O
is O
not O
a O
right O
of O
private O
judgment O
to O
be O
exercised O
, O
so O
far O
at O
least O
as O
to O
petition O
for O
a O
repeal O
, O
or O
to O
determine O
the O
expediency O
of O
risking O
a O
trial O
at O
law O
, O
the O
parliament B-Organization
might O
make O
itself O
arbitrary O
, O
which O
it O
is O
conceived O
it O
can O
not O
by O
the O
constitution O
. O

— O
I O
think O
every O
man O
has O
a O
right O
to O
examine O
as O
freely O
into O
the O
origin O
, O
spring O
and O
foundation O
of O
every O
power O
and O
measure O
in O
a O
commonwealth O
, O
as O
into O
a O
piece O
of O
curious O
machinery O
, O
or O
a O
remarkable O
phenomenon O
in O
nature O
; O
and O
that O
it O
ought O
to O
give O
no O
more O
offence O
to O
say O
, O
the O
parliament O
have O
erred O
, O
or O
are O
mistaken O
, O
in O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
or O
of O
right O
, O
than O
to O
say O
it O
of O
a O
private O
man O
, O
if O
it O
is O
true O
of O
both O
. O

If O
the O
assertion O
can O
be O
proved O
with O
regard O
to O
either O
, O
it O
is O
a O
kindness O
done O
them O
to O
show O
them O
the O
truth O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
public O
, O
it O
is O
the O
duty O
of O
every O
good O
citizen O
to O
point O
out O
what O
he O
thinks O
erroneous O
in O
the O
commonwealth B-Organization

I O
have O
waited O
years O
in O
hopes O
to O
see O
some O
one O
friend O
of O
the O
colonies B-Location
pleading O
in O
publick O
for O
them O
. O

I O
have O
waited O
in O
vain O

One O
priviledge O
is O
taken O
away O
after O
another O

and O
where O
we O
shall O
be O
landed O

God O
knows O
, O
and O
I O
trust O
will O
protect O
and O
provide O
for O
us O
even O
should O
we O
be O
driven O
and O
persecuted O
into O
a O
more O
western O
wilderness O
, O
on O
the O
score O
of O
liberty O
, O
civil O
and O
religious O
, O
as O
many O
of O
our O
ancestors O
were O
, O
to O
these O
once O
inhospitable O
shores B-Location
of I-Location
America I-Location
. O

I O
had O
formed O
great O
expectations O
from O
a O
gentleman O
, O
who O
published O
his O
first O
volume O
in O
quarto O
on O
the O
rights O
of O
the O
colonies B-Location
two O
years O
since O
; O
but O
, O
as O
he O
foresaw O
, O
the O
state O
of O
his O
health O
and O
affairs O
have O
prevented O
his O
further O
progress O
. O

The O
misfortune O
is O
, O
gentlemen O
in O
America B-Location
, O
the O
best O
qualified O
in O
every O
respect O
to O
state O
the O
rights O
of O
the O
colonists O
, O
have O
reasons O
that O
prevent O
them O
from O
engaging O
: O
Some O
of O
them O
have O
good O
ones O
. O

There O
are O
many O
infinitely O
better O
able O
to O
serve O
this O
cause O
than O
I O
pretend O
to O
be O
; O
but O
from O
indolence O
, O
from O
timidity O
, O
or O
by O
necessary O
engagements O
, O
they O
are O
prevented O
. O

There O
has O
been O
a O
most O
profound O
, O
and O
I O
think O
shameful O
silence O
, O
till O
it O
seems O
almost O
too O
late O
to O
assert O
our O
indisputable O
rights O
as O
men O
and O
as O
citizens O
. O

What O
must O
posterity O
think O
of O
us O
. O

The O
trade O
of O
the O
whole O
continent B-Location
taxed O
by O
parliament B-Organization
, O
stamps O
and O
other O
internal O
duties O
and O
taxes O
as O
they O
are O
called O
, O
talked O
of O
, O
and O
not O
one O
petition O
to O
the O
King B-Organization
and O
Parliament B-Organization
for O
relief O
. O

I O
cannot O
but O
observe O
here O
, O
that O
if O
the O
parliament B-Organization
have O
an O
equitable O
right O
to O
tax O
our O
trade O
, O
’ O
tis O
indisputable O
that O
they O
have O
as O
good O
an O
one O
to O
tax O
the O
lands O
, O
and O
every O
thing O
else O
. O

The O
taxing O
trade O
furnishes O
one O
reason O
why O
the O
other O
should O
be O
taxed O
, O
or O
else O
the O
burdens O
of O
the O
province O
will O
be O
unequally O
born O
, O
upon O
a O
supposition O
that O
a O
tax O
on O
trade O
is O
not O
a O
tax O
on O
the O
whole O
. O

But O
take O
it O
either O
way O
, O
there O
is O
no O
foundation O
for O
the O
distinction O
some O
make O
in O
England B-Location
, O
between O
an O
internal O
and O
an O
external O
tax O
on O
the O
colonies B-Person
. O

By O
the O
first O
is O
meant O
a O
tax O
on O
trade O
, O
by O
the O
latter O
a O
tax O
on O
land O
, O
and O
the O
things O
on O
it O
. O

A O
tax O
on O
trade O
is O
either O
a O
tax O
of O
every O
man O
in O
the O
province O
, O
or O
’ O
tis O
not O
. O

If O
’ O
tis O
not O
a O
tax O
on O
the O
whole O
, O
’ O
tis O
unequal O
and O
unjust O
, O
that O
a O
heavy O
burden O
should O
be O
laid O
on O
the O
trade O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
to O
maintain O
an O
army O
of O
soldiers O
, O
customhouse O
officers O
, O
and O
fleets O
of O
guard-ships O
; O
all O
which O
, O
the O
incomes O
of O
both O
trade O
and O
land O
would O
not O
furnish O
means O
to O
support O
so O
lately O
as O
the O
last O
war O
, O
when O
all O
was O
at O
stake O
, O
and O
the O
colonies B-Organization
were O
reimbursed O
in O
part O
by O
parliament B-Organization

How O
can O
it O
be O
supposed O
that O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
the O
trade O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
alone O
can O
bear O
all O
this O
terrible O
burden O

The O
late O

as O
they O
have O
been O

and O
as O
beneficial O
as O
they O
are O
to O
Great-Britain B-Organization

are O
only O
a O
security O
to O
these O

If O
it O
be O
said O
that O
a O
tax O
on O
the O

of O

is O
an O
equal O
and O
just O
tax O
on O
the O

: O
What O
then O
becomes O
of O
the O
notable O
distinction O
between O
external O
and O
internal O
taxes O
? O

Why O
may O
not O
the O
parliament B-Organization
lay O
stamps O

establish O
tythes O
to O

I O
esteem O

the O
best O

had O
as O
ornaments O
of O
it O
many O
of O
the O
greatest O

best O
men O
in O
the O
world O
. O

But O
to O
those O
colonies B-Organization
who O
in O
general O
dissent O
from O
a O
principle O
of O
conscience O
, O
it O
would O
seem O
a O
little O
hard O
to O
pay O
towards O
the O
support O
of O
a O
worship O
, O
whose O
modes O
they O
cannot O
conform O
to O

If O
an O
army O
must O
be O
kept O
up O
in O
America B-Location
, O
at O
the O
expence O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
it O
would O
not O
seem O
quite O
so O
hard O
if O
after O
the O
parliament B-Organization
had O
determined O
the O
sum O
to O
be O
raised O
, O
and O
apportioned O
it O
, O
to O
have O
allowed O
each O
colony O
to O
assess O
its O
quota O
, O
and O
raise O
it O
as O
easily O
to O
themselves O
as O
might O
be O
. O

But O
to O
have O
the O
whole O
levied O
and O
collected O
without O
our O
consent O
is O
extraordinary O
. O
’ O
Tis O
allowed O
even O
to O

and O
those O
laid O
under O

to O

the O

The O
case O
of O

certainly O
likely O
to O
be O
the O
hardest O
that O

be O
instanced O

Will O
it O
not O
equal O
any O

down O

Was O
there O
ever O
a O

in O

I O
am O
aware O

will O
be O
objected O

that O

of O
Great B-Organization
Britain I-Organization
, O
since O

union O

have O
from O
early O
days O
to O
this O
time O
, O
made O
acts O
to O
bind O

not O
to O

Ireland B-Location
: O
I O
answer O
, O
Ireland O
is O
a O
conquered O
country O
. O

I O
do O
not O
, O
however O
, O
lay O
so O
much O
stress O
on O
this O
; O
for O
it O
is O
my O
opinion O
, O
that O
a O
conquered O
country O
has O
, O
upon O
submission O
and O
good O
behaviour O
, O
the O
same O
right O
to O
be O
free O
, O
under O
a O
conqueror O
, O
as O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
subjects O
. O

But O
the O
old O
notion O
of O
the O
right O
of O
conquest O
, O
has O
been O
, O
in O
most O
nations O
, O
the O
cause O
of O
many O
severities O
and O
heinous O
breaches O
of O
the O
law O
of O
nature O
: O
If O
any O
such O
have O
taken O
place O
with O
regard O
to O
Ireland B-Organization
, O
they O
should O
form O
no O
precedent O
for O

The O
subordination O
and O

of O

The O
subordination O
of O

never O

He O
indeed O

make O
a O

point O

it O
, O
whether O
the O

legislative O
power O
is O
as O
independent O
“ O

that O

it O
is O
to O

subordinate O

The O

unquestionably O
subordinate O

of O

I O
shall O
endeavour O

the O
nature O

has O
puzzled O

many O
in O

the O

The O

I O
believe O
, O
has O
expended O
more O
men O

money O
in O
war O
since O
the O
year O
1620 O
, O
when O
a O

, O
in O
proportion O
to O
their O
ability O
, O
than O
the O
three B-Location
Kingdoms I-Location
together O
. O

The O
same O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
may O
be O
truly O
affirmed O
, O
of O
many O
of O
the O
other O
colonies O
; O
tho O
’ O
the O
Massachusetts B-Organization
has O
undoubtedly O
had O
the O
heaviest O
burthen O
. O

This O
may O
be O
thought O
incredible O
: O
but O
materials O
are O
collecting O
; O
and O
tho O
’ O
some O
are O
lost O
, O
enough O
may O
remain O
, O
to O
demonstrate O
it O
to O
the O
world O
. O

I O
have O
reason O
to O
hope O
at O
least O
, O
that O
the O
public O
will O
soon O
see O
such O
proofs O
exhibited O
, O
as O
will O
show O
, O
that O
I O
do O
not O
speak O
quite O
at O
random O
. O

Why O
then O
is O
it O
thought O
so O
heinous O
by O
the O
author B-Person
of I-Person
the I-Person
administration I-Person
of I-Person
the I-Person
colonies I-Person
, O
and O
others O
, O
that O
the O

should O
aspire O
after O
“ O
a O
one O

” O
not O
independent O
of O

but O
subordinate O
to O
the O
laws O

? O

— O
It O
is O
a O
mistake O
in O
this O
author B-Person
, O
to O
bring O
so O
heavy O
a O
charge O
as O
high O
treason O
against O
some O
of O

, O
which O
he O
does O
in O
effect O
in O
this O
place O
, O
16 O
by O
representing O
them O
as O
“ O
claiming O

, O
the O

full O

holds O
by O
its O

under O
the O
great O

” O

No O
such O
claim O
was O
ever O
tho O
’ O
t O
of O
by O
any O
of O
the O
colonists O
. O

They O
are O
all O
better O
men O
and O
better O
subjects O
; O
and O
many O
of O
them O
too O
well O
versed O
in O
the O
laws O
of O
nature O
and O
nations O
, O
and O
the O
law O
and O
constitution O
of O
Great-Britain B-Organization
, O
to O
think O
they O
have O
a O
right O
to O
more O
than O
a O
provincial O
subordinate O
legislative O
. O

All O
power O
is O
of O
GOD O
. O

Next O
and O
only O
subordinate O
to O
him O
, O
in O
the O
present O
state O
of O
the O
well-formed O
, O
beautifully O
constructed O
British O
monarchy O
, O
standing O
where O
I O
hope O
it O
ever O
will O
stand O
, O
for O
the O
pillars O
are O
fixed O
in O
judgment O
, O
righteousness O
and O
truth O
, O
is O
the O
King B-Organization
and O
Parliament B-Organization
. O

Under O
these O
, O
it O
seems O
easy O
to O
conceive O
subordinate O
powers O
in O
gradation O
, O
till O
we O
descend O
to O
the O
legislative O
of O
a O
town O
council O
, O
or O
even O
a O
private O
social O
club O
. O

These O
have O
each O
“ O
a O
one O
whole O
legislative O
” O
subordinate O
, O
which O
, O
when O
it O
don O
’ O
t O
counteract O
the O
laws O
of O
any O
of O
its O
superiors O
, O
is O
to O
be O
indulged O
. O

Even O
when O
the O
laws O
of O
subordination O
are O
transgressed O
, O
the O
superior O
does O
not O
destroy O
the O
subordinate O
, O
but O
will O
negative O
its O
acts O
, O
as O
it O
may O
in O
all O
cases O
when O
disapproved O
. O

This O
right O
of O
negative O
is O
essential O
, O
and O
may O
be O
inforced O
: O
But O
in O
no O
case O
are O
the O
essential O
rights O
of O
the O
subjects O
, O
inhabiting O
the O
subordinate B-Location
dominions I-Location
, O
to O
be O
destroyed O
. O

This O
would O
put O
it O
in O
the O
power O
of O
the O
superior O
to O
reduce O
the O
inferior O
to O
a O
state O
of O
slavery O
; O
which O
cannot O
be O
rightfully O
done O
, O
even O
with O
conquered O
enemies O
and O
rebels O
. O

After O
satisfaction O
and O
security O
is O
obtained O
of O
the O
former O
, O
and O
examples O
are O
made O
of O
so O
many O
of O
the O
latter O
, O
as O
the O
ends O
of O
government O
require O
, O
the O
rest O
are O
to O
be O
restored O
to O
all O
the O
essential O
rights O
of O
men O
and O
of O
citizens O
. O

This O
is O
the O
great O
law O
of O
nature O
: O
and O
agreeable O
to O
this O
law O
, O
is O
the O
constant O
practice O
of O
all O
good O
and O
mild O
governments O
. O

This O
lenity O
and O
humanity O
has O
no O
where O
been O
carried O
further O
than O
in O
Great B-Location
Britain I-Location
. O

The O
Colonies B-Organization
have O
been O
so O
remarkable O
for O
loyalty O
, O
that O
there O
never O
has O
been O
any O
instance O
of O
rebellion O
or O
treason O
in O
them O
. O

This O
loyalty O
is O
in O
very O
handsome O
terms O
acknowledged O
by O
the O
author B-Person
of I-Person
the I-Person
administration I-Person
of I-Person
the I-Person
colonies I-Person
. O

“ O
It O
has O
been O
often O
suggested O
that O
care O
should O
be O
taken O
in O
the O
administration O
of O
the O
plantations B-Location
, O
lest O
, O
in O
some O
future O
time O
, O
these O
colonies B-Organization
should O
become O
independent O
of O
the O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
. O

But O
perhaps O
it O
may O
be O
proper O
on O
this O
occasion O
, O
nay O
, O
it O
is O
justice O
to O
say O
it O
, O
that O
if O
, O
by O
becoming O
independent O
, O
is O
meant O
a O
revolt O
, O
nothing O
is O
further O
from O
their O
nature O
, O
their O
interest O
, O
their O
thoughts O
. O

If O
a O
defection O
from O
the O
alliance O
of O
the O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
be O
suggested O
, O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
, O
and O
can O
be O
truly O
said O
, O
that O
their O
spirit O
abhors O
the O
sense O
of O
such O
; O
their O
attachment O
to O
the O
protestant O
succession O
in O
the O
house O
of O
Hanover O
, O
will O
ever O
stand O
unshaken O
; O
and O
nothing O
can O
eradicate O
from O
their O
hearts O
their O
natural O
and O
almost O
mechanical O
, O
affection O
to O
Great B-Location
Britain I-Location
, O
which O
they O
conceive O
under O
no O
other O
sense O
, O
nor O
call O
by O
any O
other O
name O
, O
than O
that O
of O
home O
. O

Any O
such O
suggestion O
, O
therefore O
, O
is O
a O
false O
and O
unjust O
aspersion O
on O
their O
principles O
and O
affections O
; O
and O
can O
arise O
from O
nothing O
but O
an O
intire O
ignorance O
of O
their O
circumstances O
. O
” O
17 O
After O
all O
this O
loyalty O
, O
it O
is O
a O
little O
hard O
to O
be O
charged O
with O
claiming O
, O
and O
represented O
as O
aspiring O
after O
, O
independency O
. O

The O
inconsistency O
of O
this O
I O
leave O
. O

We O
have O
said O
that O
the O
loyalty O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
has O
never O
been O
suspected O
; O
this O
must O
be O
restricted O
to O
a O
just O
suspicion O
. O

For O
it O
seems O
there O
have O
long O
been O
groundless O
suspicions O
of O
us O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
individuals O
. O

And O
there O
have O
always O
been O
those O
who O
have O
endeavoured O
to O
magnify O
these O
chimerical O
fears O
. O

I O
find O
Mr B-Person
. I-Person
Dummer I-Person
complaining O
of O
this O
many O
years O
since O
. O

“ O
There O
is O
, O
says O
he O
, O
one O
thing O
more O
I O
have O
heard O
often O
urged O
against O
the O
charter B-Organization

and O
indeed O
tis O
what O
one O
meets O
with O
from O
people O
of O
all O
conditions O
and O
qualities O
, O
tho O
’ O
with O
due O
respect O
to O
their O
better O
judgments O
, O
I O
can O
see O
neither O
reason O
nor O
colour O
for O
it O

’ O

said O
that O
their O
increasing O
numbers O
and O
wealth O
, O
joined O
to O
their O
great O
distance O
from O

, O
will O
give O
them O
an O
opportunity O
, O
in O
the O
course O
of O
some O
years O
, O
to O
throw O
off O
their O
dependence O
on O
the O
nation B-Organization

and O
declare O
themselves O
a O
free O
state O
, O
if O
not O
curb O

in O
time O
, O
by O
being O
made O
entirely O
subject O
to O
the O
crown B-Organization

” O
18 O
This O
jealousy O
has O
been O
so O
long O
talked O
of O
, O
that O
many O
seem O
to O
believe O
it O
really O
well O
grounded O
. O

Not O
that O
there O
is O
danger O
of O
a O
“ O
revolt O
” O
, O
even O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
author B-Person
of I-Person
the I-Person
administration I-Person
, O
but O
that O
the O
colonists O
will O
by O
fraud O
or O
force O
, O
avail O
themselves O
, O
in O
“ O
fact O
or O
in O
deed O
” O
, O
of O
an O
independent O
legislature O
. O

This O
, O
I O
think O
, O
would O
be O
a O
revolting O
with O
a O
vengeance O
. O

What O
higher O
revolt O
can O
there O
be O
, O
than O
for O
a O
province O
to O
assume O
the O
right O
of O
an O
independent O
legislative O
, O
or O
state O
? O

I O
must O
therefore O
think O
this O
a O
greater O
aspersion O
on O
the O
Colonists O
, O
than O
to O
charge O
them O
with O
a O
design O
to O
revolt O
, O
in O
the O
sense O
in O
which O
the O
Gentleman O
allows O
they O
have O
been O
abused O
: O
It O
is O
a O
more O
artful O
and O
dangerous O
way O
of O
attacking O
our O
liberties O
, O
than O
to O
charge O
us O
with O
being O
in O
open O
rebellion O
. O

That O
could O
be O
confuted O
instantly O
: O
but O
this O
seeming O
indirect O
way O
of O
charging O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
with O
a O
desire O
of O
throwing O
off O
their O
dependency O
, O
requires O
more O
pains O
to O
confute O
it O
than O
the O
other O
, O
therefore O
it O
has O
been O
recurred O
to O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
Gentlemen O
have O
had O
departments O
in O
America B-Location
, O
the O
functions O
of O
which O
they O
have O
not O
been O
fortunate O
in O
executing O

The O
people O
have O
by O
these O
means O
been O
rendered O
uneasy O

at O
bad O
Provincial O
measures O

They O
have O
been O
represented O
as O
factious O
, O
seditious O
, O
and O
inclined O
to O
democracy O
, O
whenever O
they O
have O
refused O
passive O
obedience O
to O
provincial O
mandates O
, O
as O
arbitrary O
as O
those O
of O
a O
Turkish O
Bashaw O
: O
I O
say O
, O
Provincial O
mandates O
; O
for O
to O
the O
King B-Organization

Parliament B-Organization
they O
have O
been O
ever O
submissive O
and O
obedient O
. O

These O
representations O
of O
us O
, O
many O
of O
the O
good O
people O
of O
England B-Location
swallow O
with O
as O
much O
ease O
, O
as O
they O
would O
a O
bottle-bubble O

any O

they O
may O
all O

either O

to O
the O

I O
only O
ask O
, O
who O
makes O
the O
judges O
in O
the O
provinces B-Location
? O

I O
know O
of O
but O
two O
colonies B-Organization
, O
viz O
. O

Connecticut B-Location
and O
Rhode-Island B-Location
, O
where O
they O
are O
chosen O
by O
the O
people O
. O

In O
all O
other O
colonies B-Location
, O
they O
are O
either O
immediately O
appointed O
by O
the O
crown B-Organization
, O
or O
by O
his O
Majesty B-Organization
’ I-Organization

governor I-Organization

with O
the O

of O
what O
the O

calls O
, O
the O
“ O
governor B-Organization
’ I-Organization

of I-Organization

. O
” O

And O
if O
they O
are O
in O
general O
such O
ignorant O
creatures O
, O
as O
the O
Administrator B-Person
describes O
them O
, O
’ O
tis O
the O
misfortune O
, O
not O
the O
fault O
, O
of O
the O
people O
, O
in O
the O
colonies B-Location
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
justice O
in O
general O
, O
is O
as O
well O
administred O
in O
the O
colonies B-Location
, O
as O
it O
will O
be O
when O
every O
thing O
is O
devolved O
upon O
a O
court O
of O
admiralty O
, O
general O
or O
provincial O
. O

The O
following O
is O
very O
remarkable O
. O

“ O
In O
those O
popular O
governments O
, O
and O
where O
every O
executive O
officer O
is O
under O
a O
dependence O
for O
a O
temporary O
, O
wretched O
, O
and O
I O
had O
almost O
said O
arbitrary O
support O
, O
on O
the O
deputies O
of O
the O
people O
.20 O
Why O
is O
the O
temporary O
support O
found O
fault O
with O
? O

Would O
it O
be O
wise O
to O
give O
a O
governor O
a O
salary O
for O
a O
longer O
time O
than O
his O
political O
life O
? O

As O
this O
is O
quite O
as O
uncertain O
as O
his O
natural O
life O
, O
it O
has O
been O
granted O
annually O
. O

So O
every O
governor O
has O
the O
chance O
of O
one O
year O
’ O
s O
salary O
after O
he O
is O
dead O
. O

All O
the O
King B-Organization
’ I-Organization
s I-Organization
officers I-Organization
, O
are O
not O
even O
in O
the O
charter B-Location
provinces I-Location
“ O
dependent O
on O
the O
people O
” O
for O
support O
. O

The O
judges O
of O
the O
admiralty O
, O
these O
mirrors O
of O
justice O
, O
to O
be O
trusted O
, O
when O
none O
of O
the O
common B-Organization
law I-Organization
courts I-Organization
are O
, O
have O
all O
their O
commissions O
from O
home O
. O

These O
, O
besides O
other O
fees O
, O
have O
so O
much O
per O
cent O
on O
all O
they O
condemn O
, O
be O
it O
right O
or O
wrong O
, O
and O
this O
by O
act O
of O

. O

Yet O
so O
great O
is O
their O
integrity O
, O
that O
it O
never O
was O
suspected O
that O
50 O
per O
cent O
, O
if O
allowed O
, O
would O
have O
any O
influence O
on O
their O

Custom-house O

universally O
, O
and O
Naval-officers O
, O
in O
all O
but O
two O
or O
three O
of O
the O
colonies B-Location
, O
are O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
appointed O
directly O
from O
home O
, O
or O
by O
instruction O
to O
the O
Governor B-Organization
: O
and O
take O
just O
what O
they O
please O
, O
for O
any O
restraint O
they O
are O
under O
by O
the O
provincial O
acts O

But O
on O
whom O
should O
a O
Governor O
depend O
for O
his O
honorable O
support O
, O
but O
the O
people O
? O

Is O
not O
the O
King B-Organization
fed O
from O
the O
field O
, O
and O
from O
the O
labor O
of O
his O
people O
? O

Does O
not O
his O
Majesty B-Organization
himself O
receive O
his O
aids O
from O
the O
free O
grant O
of O
his O
parliament B-Organization
? O

Do O
not O
all O
these O
originate O
in O
the O
house B-Organization
of I-Organization
commons I-Organization
? O

Did O
the O
house B-Organization
of I-Organization
Lords I-Organization
ever O
originate O
a O
grant O
? O

Do O
not O
our O
law O
books O
inform O
us O
that O
the O
Lords B-Organization
only O
assent O
or O
dissent O
, O
but O
never O
so O
much O
as O
propose O
an O
amendment O
, O
on O
a O

? O

The O
King B-Organization
can O
take O
no O
more O
than O
the O
Parliament B-Organization
will O
give O
him O
, O
and O
yet O
some O
of O
his O
Governors O
have O
tho O
’ O
t O
it O
an O
insufferable O
hardship O
, O
that O
they O
could O

To O
take O
leave O
of O
the O
administrator O
, O
there O
are O
in O
his O
book O
some O
good O
hints O
, O
but O
a O
multiplicity O
of O
mistakes O
in O
fact O
, O
and O
errors O
in O
matters O
of O
right O
, O
which O
I O
have O
not O
time O
to O
mention O
particularly O
. O

Ireland B-Location
is O
a O
conquered O
kingdom O
; O
and O
yet O
have O
tho O
’ O
t O
they O
received O
very O
hard O
measure O
in O
some O
of O
the O
prohibitions O
and O
restrictions O
of O
their O
trade O
. O

But O
were O
the O
colonies B-Location
ever O
conquered O
? O

Have O
they O
not O
been O
subject O
and O
obedient O
, O
and O
loyal O
from O
their O
settlement O
? O

Were O
not O
the O
settlements O
made O
under O
the O
British B-Organization
laws O
and O
constitution O
? O

But O
if O
the O
colonies B-Location
were O
all O
to O
be O
considered O
as O
conquered O
, O
they O
are O
entitled O
to O
the O
essential O
rights O
of O
men O

citizens O
. O

And O
therefore O
admitting O
the O
right O
of O
prohibition O
, O
in O
its O
utmost O
extent O
and O
latitude O
; O
a O
right O
of O
taxation O
can O
never O
be O
infer O
’ O
d O
from O
that O
. O

It O
may O
be O
for O
the O
good O
of O
the O
whole O
, O
that O
a O
certain O
commodity O
should O
be O
prohibited O
: O
But O
this O
power O
should O
be O
exercised O
, O
with O
great O
moderation O
and O
impartiality O
, O
over O
dominions O
, O
which O
are O
not O
represented O
, O
in O
the O
national B-Organization
parliament I-Organization

I O
had O
however O
rather O
see O
this O
carried O
with O
a O
high O
hand O
, O
to O
the O
utmost O
rigor O
, O
than O
have O
a O
tax O
of O
one O

A O

may O
be O

happy O

free O
and O
easy O
among O
themselves O
, O
without O
a O
particular O
branch O
of O

I O
am O
sure O
these O

have O
the O
natural O
means O
of O
every O
manufacture O

Europe B-Location

and O
some O
that O

out O
of O

to O
make O

It O
will O
scarcely O
be O
believed O
a O
hundred O
years O
hence O
, O
that O
the O
American O
manufactures O
could O
have O
been O
brought O
to O
such O
perfection O
, O
as O
they O
will O
then O
probably O
be O
in O
, O
if O
the O

measures O

One O

than O

they O
now O
bid O
fair O

the O
English O
, O
in O
every O
port O

All O
the O

that O
Great-Britain B-Organization

make O

would O
be O
consumed O
in O

in O

if O

a O
right O
footing O

a O

believe O

whether O

“ O
the O
court B-Organization

bench O
has O
a O
power O
to O
restrain O
the O
court O

England B-Location
; O
and O
the O
reasons O
for O
such O
restraining O
power O
are O
as O
strong O
in O
New B-Location
England I-Location
as O
in O
Great-Britain B-Location
, O
” O
and O
in O
some O
respects O
more O
so O
: O
Yet O
Mr B-Person

Dummer I-Person
mentions O
, O
a O
clamour O
that O
was O
raised O
at O
home O
by O
a O
judge O
of O
the O
admiralty O
for O
New B-Location
England I-Location
, O
who O
complain O
’ O
d O
“ O
that O
the O
common B-Organization
law I-Organization
courts I-Organization
by O
granting O
prohibitions O
, O
weaken O
, O

in O
a O
manner O
suppress O

that O

while O
the O
sugar B-Organization

have O
born O
little O
or O
no O
share O
in O
it O

They O
indeed O
sent O
a O
company O

two O
of O
Negroes O

Molattoes O

if O
this O
be O
worth O
mentioning O
, O
to O
the O
sieges O
of O
Gaudaloupe B-Location
, O
Martineco B-Location
and O
the O
Havanna B-Location
: O
I O
do O
not O
recollect O
any O
thing O
else O
that O
they O
have O
done O
; O
while O
the O
flower O
of O
our O
youth O
were O
annually O
pressed O
by O
ten O
thousands O
into O
the O
service O
, O
and O
there O
treated O
but O
little O
better O
, O
as O
we O
have O
been O
told O
, O
than O
hewers O
of O
wood O
and O
drawers O
of O
water O
. O

Provincial O
acts O
for O
impressing O
were O
obtained O
, O
only O
by O
letters O
of O
requisition O
from O
a O
secretary O
of O
state O
to O
a O
Governor O
; O
requiring O
him O
to O
use O
his O
influence O
to O
raise O
men O
; O
and O
sometimes O
, O
more O
than O
were O
asked O
for O
or O
wanted O
, O
were O
pressed O
, O
to O
give O
a O
figure O
to O
the O
Governor O
, O
and O
shew O
his O
influence O
; O
a O
remarkable O
instance O
of O
which O
might O
be O
mentioned O
. O

I O
would O
further O
observe O
, O
that O
Great-Britain B-Organization
was O
as O
immediately O
interested O
in O
the O
late O
war O
in O
America B-Location
, O
as O
the O
colonies B-Organization
were O
. O

Was O
she O
not O
threatned O
with O
an O
invasion O
at O
the O
same O
time O
we O
were O
? O

Has O
she O
not O
an O
immense O
trade O
to O
the O
colonies B-Location
? O

The O
British O
writers O
say O
, O
more O
than O
half O
her O
profitable O
trade O
is O
to O
America B-Location
: O
All O
the O
profits O
of O
our O
trade O
center O
there O
, O
and O
is O
little O
enough O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
goods O
we O
import O
. O

A O
prodigious O
revenue O
arises O
to O
the O
Crown B-Organization
on O
American O
exports O
to O
Great-Britain B-Location
, O
which O
in O
general O
is O
not O
murmured O
at O
: O
No O
manufacture O
of O
Europe B-Location
besides O
British O
, O
can O
be O
lawfully O
bro O
’ O
t O
here O
; O
and O
no O
honest O
man O
desires O
they O
ever O
should O
, O
if O
the O
laws O
were O
put O
in O
execution O
upon O
all O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
a O
few O
Dutch O
imports O
that O
have O
made O
such O
a O
noise O
, O
the O
truth O
is O
, O
very O
little O
has O
been O
or O
could O
be O
run O
, O
before O
the O
apparatus O
of O
guardships O
; O
for O
the O
officers O
of O
some O
ports O
did O
their O
duty O
, O
while O
others O
may O
have O
made O
a O
monopoly O
of O
smuggling O
, O
for O
a O
few O
of O
their O
friends O
, O
who O
probably O
paid O
them O
large O
contributions O
; O
for O
it O
has O
been O
observed O
, O
that O
a O
very O
small O
office O
in O
the O
customs O
in O
America B-Location
has O
raised O
a O
man O
a O
fortune O
sooner O
than O
a O
Government O
. O

The O
truth O
is O
, O
the O
acts O
of O
trade O
have O
been O
too O
often O
evaded O
; O
but O
by O
whom O
? O

Not O
by O
the O
American O
merchants O
in O
general O
, O
but O
by O
some O
former O
customhouse O
officers O
, O
their O
friends O
and O
partizans O
. O

I O
name O
no O
man O
, O
not O
being O
about O

: O
But O
it O
has O
been O
a O
notorious O
grievance O
, O
that O
when O
the O
King B-Organization
himself O
cannot O
dispense O
with O
an O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
, O
there O
have O
been O
customhouse O

have O
practised O
it O
for O
years O
together O
, O
in O
favor O
of O
those O
towards O
whom O
they O
were O
graciously O
disposed O
. O

But O
to O
return O
to O
the O
subject O
of O
taxation O
: O
I O
find O
that O
“ O
the O
lords B-Organization

be O
charged O

any O
thing O

cannot O
see O
the O
great O
difference O
in O
equity O
, O

with O

that O

the O

When O

a O

of O
taking O

, O
by O

This O
defence O
is O
dedicated O
to O

right O

the O
Ld O

Carteret B-Person
, O
then O
one O
of O

’ O

principal O
secretaries B-Organization
of I-Organization

, O
since O
Earl B-Person
of I-Person
Granville I-Person
. O

His O
third O
proposition O
is O
, O
that O
“ O
it O
is O
not O
for O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
crown B-Organization
to O
resume O
the O
charters O
, O
if O
forfeited O
. O
” O

This O
he O
proves O
; O
as O
also O
that O
it O
would O
be O
more O
for O
the O
interest O
of O
Great B-Location
Britain I-Location
to O
enlarge O
, O
rather O
than O
diminish O
, O
the O
privilege O
of O
all O
the O
colonists O
. O

His O
last O
proposition O
is O
, O
that O
it O
“ O
seems O
inconsistent O
with O
justice O
to O
disfranchise O
the O
charter B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
by O
an O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
. O
” O

“ O
It O
seems O
therefore O
, O
says O
he O
, O
a O
severity O
without O
a O
precedent O
, O
that O
a O
people O
, O
who O
have O
the O
misfortune O
of O
being O
a O
thousand O
leagues O
distant O
from O
their O
sovereign O
, O
a O
misfortune O
great O
enough O
in O
itself O
, O
should O
, O
unsummoned O
, O
unheard O
, O
in O
one O
day O
, O
be O
deprived O
of O
their O
valuable O
privileges O
, O
which O
they O
and O
their O
fathers O
have O
enjoyed O
for O
near O
a O
hundred O
years O
. O
” O
’ O
Tis O
true O
, O
as O
he O
observes O
, O
“ O
the O
legislative O
power O
is O
absolute O
and O
unaccountable O
, O
and O
King B-Organization
, O
lords B-Organization
and O
commons B-Organization
, O
may O
do O
what O
they O
please O
; O
but O
the O
question O
here O
is O
not O
about O
power O
, O
but O
right O
” O
( O
or O
rather O
equity O
) O
“ O
and O
shall O
not O
the O
supreme B-Organization
judicature I-Organization
of I-Organization
all I-Organization
the I-Organization
nation I-Organization
do O
right O
” O
? O

“ O
One O
may O
say O
, O
that O
what O
the O
parliament B-Organization
cannot O
do O
justly O
, O
they O
cannot O
do O
at O
all O
. O

In O
maximis O

The O
higher O
the O
power O
is O
, O
the O
greater O
caution O
is O
to O
be O
used O
in O
the O
execution O
of O
it O
; O
because O
the O
sufferer O
is O
helpless O
and O
without O
resort O
. O
” O

I O
never O
heard O
that O
this O
reasoning O
gave O
any O
offence O
. O

Why O
should O
it O
? O

Is O
it O
not O
exactly O
agreeable O
to O
the O
decisions O
of O
parliament B-Organization
and O
the O
determinations O
of O
the O
highest B-Organization
executive I-Organization
courts I-Organization
? O

( O
See O
the O
Appendix O
. O
) O

But O
if O
it O
was O
thought O
hard O
that O
charter O
privileges O
should O
be O
taken O
away O
by O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
, O
Is O
it O
not O
much O
harder O
to O
be O
in O
part O
, O
or O
in O
whole O
, O
disfranchised O
of O
rights O
, O
that O
have O
been O
always O

all O
taxes O
, O
but O
what O
he O
consents O
to O
in O
person O
, O
or O
by O
his O
representative O
? O

This O
right O
, O
if O
it O
could O
be O
traced O
no O
higher O
than O

, O
is O
part O

right O

by O

parliament B-Organization

us O
before O

, O
as O
if O
the O

should O
do O
it O
by O
his O
prerogative O
? O

Can O
it O
be O
said O
with O
any O
colour O
of O
truth O
or O
justice O
, O
that O
we O

As O
to O

I O
know O
of O

From O
all O
which O
, O
it O
seems O
plain O
, O
that O
the O
reason O
why O
Ireland B-Location
and O
the O
plantations B-Organization
are O
not O
bound O
, O
unless O
named O
by O
an O
Act O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
, O
is O
, O
because O
they O
are O
not O
represented O
in O
the O
British O
parliament B-Organization

Yet O
, O
in O
special O
cases O
, O
the O
British O
parliament B-Organization
has O
an O
undoubted O
right O
, O
as O
well O
as O
power O
, O
to O
bind O
both O
by O
their O
acts O

But O
whether O
this O
can O
be O
extended O
to O
an O
indefinite O
taxation O
of O
both O
, O
is O
the O
great O
question O
. O

I O
conceive O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
British O
constitution O
must O
make O
an O
exception O
of O
all O
taxes O
, O
until O
it O
is O
tho O
’ O
t O
fit O
to O
unite O
a O
dominion O
to O

Such O
taxation O
must O
be O
considered O
either O
as O
uniting O
the O
dominions B-Organization
to O
the O
realm O
, O
or O
disfranchising O
them O
. O

If O
they O
are O
united O
, O
they O
will O
be O
intitled O
to O
a O

as O
well O
as O
Wales B-Organization

if O
they O
are O
so O
taxed O
without O
a O
union O
, O
or O
representation O
, O
they O
are O
so O
far O
disfranchised O
. O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
find O
any O
thing O
that O

I O
look O
on O
this O

tho O
’ O
it O
imposes O
a O

terms O

has O
been O

to O
be O
designed O
for O
a O
prohibition O

which O
is O

from O

may O

just O
they O

I O

I O
read O
of O

nomination O
, O
that O
the O
city B-Organization

taxes O
its O

; O
I O
know O
of O
no O
forts O

garrisons O
that O
the O
city B-Organization

London I-Organization
has O
lately O
built O
at O
its O

of O
any O

that O
they O
have O
raised O
for O
the O
King B-Organization
’ O

service O
and O
the O
common O
cause O

These O
are O
things O
very O
fitting O
and O
proper O
to O
be O
done O
by O
a O
subordinate O
dominion O
, O
and O
tis O
their O
duty O
to O
do O
all O
they O
are O
able O
; O
but O
it O
seems O
but O
equal O
they O
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
assess O
the O
charges O
of O
it O
themselves O
. O

The O
rules O
of O

the O
principles O
of O
the O

seem O
to O
require O
this O

Those O
who O
judge O
of O
the O
reciprocal O
rights O
that O
subsist O
between O
a O
supreme O
and O
subordinate O
state O

, O
by O
no O
higher O
rules O
than O
are O
applied O
to O
a O
corporation O

will O
never O
have O
a O
very O
comprehensive O
view O

Yet O
sorry O
am O
I O
to O
say O
it O
, O
many O
elaborate O
writers O
on O
the O

seem O
to O
me O
never O
to O
rise O
higher O
in O

notions O
, O
than O
what O
might O
be O
expected O
from O
a O
secretary O
to O
one O
of O
the O
quorum O

If O
I O
should O
be O
ranked O
among O
this O
number O
, O
I O
shall O
have O
this O
consolation O
, O
that O
I O
have O
fallen O
into O
what O
is O
called O
very O
good O
company O
, O
and O
among O
some O
who O
have O
seen O
very O
high O
life O
below O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
Administrator B-Person

that O
of O
whatever O
revenues O
raised O
in O
the O

if O
they O

the O

would O
be O

It O
was O
on O
this O
principle O
that O
at O
the O
last O
assembly B-Organization
of I-Organization
this I-Organization
province I-Organization
, O
I O
moved O
to O
stop O
every O

the O
officers O
of O
the O

more O
especially O
as O
I O
know O
some O
who O
have O
built O
very O
much O
upon O
the O
fine O
salaries O
they O
shall O
receive O
from O
the O
plantation O
branch O
of O
the O

. O

Nor O
can O
I O
think O
it O
“ O
injustice O
to O
the O
frame O
of O
human O
nature O
, O
” O
22 O
to O
suppose O
, O
if O
I O
did O
not O
know O
it O
, O
that O
with O
similar O
views O
several O
officers O
of O
the O
Crown B-Organization
in O
some O
of O
the O
colonies B-Location
have O
been O
pushing O
for O
such O
an O
act O
for O
many O
years O
. O

They O
have O
obtained O
their O
wish O
, O
and O
much O
good O
it O
will O
do O
them O
: O
But O
I O
would O
not O
give O
much O
for O
all O
that O
will O
center O
neat O
in O
the O
exchequer O
, O
after O
deducting O
the O
costs O
attending O
the O
execution O
of O
it O
, O
and O
the O
appropriations O
to O
the O
several O
officers O
proposed O
by O
the O
Administrator B-Person
. O

What O
will O
be O
the O
unavoidable O
consequence O
of O
all O
this O
, O
suppose O
another O
war O
should O
happen O
, O
and O
it O
should O
be O
necessary O
to O
employ O
as O
many O
provincials O
in O
America B-Location
as O
in O
the O
last O
? O

Would O
it O
be O
possible O
for O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
after O
being O
burthened O
in O
their O
trade O
, O
perhaps O
after O
it O
is O
ruined O
, O
to O
raise O
men O
? O

Is O
it O
probable O
that O
they O
would O
have O
spirit O
enough O
to O
exert O
themselves O
? O

If O
’ O
tis O
said O
the O
French O
will O
never O
try O
for O
America B-Location
, O
or O
if O
they O
should O
, O
regular O
troops O
are O
only O
to O
be O
employed O
. O

I O
grant O
our O
regular O
troops O
are O
the O
best O
in O
the O
world O
, O
and O
that O
the O
experience O
of O
the O
present O
officers O
shews O
that O
they O
are O
capable O
of O
every O
species O
of O
American O
service O
; O
yet O
we O
should O
guard O
against O
the O
worst O
. O

If O
another O
tryal O
for O
Canada B-Location
should O
take O
place O
, O
which O
from O
the O
known O
temper O
of O
France B-Organization
, O
we O
may O
judge O
she O
will O
bring O
on O
the O
first O
fair O
opportunity O
, O
it O
might O
require O
30 O
or O
40,000 O
regulars O
to O
secure O
his O
Majesty B-Organization
’ O
s O
just O
rights O
. O

If O
it O
should O
be O
said O
, O
that O
other O
American O
duties O
must O
then O
be O
levied O
, O
besides O
the O
impossibility O
of O
our O
being O
able O
to O
pay O
them O
, O
the O
danger O
recurs O
of O
a O
large O
standing O
army O
so O
remote O
from O
home O
. O

Whereas O
a O
good O
provincial O
militia O
, O
with O
such O
occasional O
succours O
from O
the O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
, O
as O
exigencies O
may O
require O
, O
never O
was O
, O
and O
never O
will O
be O
attended O
with O
hazard O
. O

The O
experience O
of O
past O
times O
will O
show O
, O
that O
an O
army O
of O
20 O
or O
30,000 O
veterans O
, O
half O
3000 O
miles O
from O
Rome B-Location
, O
were O
very O
apt O
to O
proclaim O
Cæsars B-Person
. O

The O
first O
of O
the O
name O
, O
the O
assassin O
of O
his O
country B-Organization
owed O
his O
false O
glory O
, O
to O
stealing O
the O
affections O
of O
an O
army O
from O
the O
commonwealth B-Organization
. O

I O
hope O
these O
hints O
will O
not O
be O
taken O
amiss O
; O
they O
seem O
to O
occur O
from O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
subject O
I O
am O
upon O
: O
They O
are O
delivered O
in O
pure O
affection O
to O
my O
King B-Organization
and O
country B-Organization
, O
and O
amount O
to O
no O
reflection O
on O
any O
man O
. O

The O
best O
army O
, O
and O
the O
best O
men O
, O
we O
may O
hereafter O
have O
, O
may O
be O
led O
into O
temptation O
; O
all O
I O
think O
, O
is O
, O
that O
a O
prevention O
of O
evil O
is O
much O
easier O
than O
a O
deliverance O
from O
it O
. O

The O
sum O
of O
my O
argument O
is O
, O
That O
civil O
government O
is O
of O
God O
: O
That O
the O
administrators O
of O
it O
were O
originally O
the O
whole O
people O
: O
That O
they O
might O
have O
devolved O
it O
on O
whom O
they O
pleased O
: O
That O
this O
devolution O
is O
fiduciary O
, O
for O
the O
good O
of O
the O
whole O
; O
That O
by O
the O
British O

this O
devolution O
is O
on O

That O
by O

broken O

: O
That O
by O

by O

the O
best O

That O

a O
right O
to O

That O

characterizes O
a O

the O
want O

laws O
made O
, O
if O
any O
are O
still O
wanting O
, O
as O
shall O
be O
best O
adapted O
to O
secure O
them O
: O
And O
we O
particularly O
desire O
you O
carefully O
to O
look O
into O
the O
laws O
of O
excise O
, O
that O
if O
the O
virtue O
of O
the O
people O
is O
endangered O
by O
the O
multiplicity O
of O
oaths O
therein O
enjoined O
, O
or O
their O
trade O
and O
business O
is O
unreasonably O
impeded O
or O
embarrassed O
thereby O
, O
the O
grievance O
may O
be O
redressed O
. O

As O
the O
preservation O
of O
morals O
, O
as O
well O
as O
property O
and O
right O
, O
so O
much O
depends O
upon O
the O
impartial O
distribution O
of O
justice O
, O
agreeable O
to O
good O
and O
wholesome O
law O
: O
And O
as O
the O
judges O
of O
the O
land O
do O
depend O
upon O
the O
free O
grants O
of O
the O
general B-Organization
assembly I-Organization
for O
support O
; O
it O
is O
incumbent O
upon O
you O
at O
all O
times O
to O
give O
your O
voice O
for O
their O
honourable O
maintenance O
, O
so O
long O
as O
they O
, O
having O
in O
their O
minds O
an O
indifference O
to O
all O
other O
affairs O
, O
shall O
devote O
themselves O
wholly O
to O
the O
duties O
of O
their O
own O
department O
, O
and O
the O
further O
study O
of O
the O
law O
, O
by O
which O
their O
customs O
, O
precedents O
, O
proceedings O
and O
determinations O
are O
adjusted O
and O
limited O
. O

You O
will O
remember O
that O
this O
province B-Organization
hath O
been O
at O
a O
very O
great O
expence O
in O
carrying O
on O
the O
war O
; O
and O
that O
it O
still O
lies O
under O
a O
very O
grievous O
burden O
of O
debt O
: O
You O
will O
therefore O
use O
your O
utmost O
endeavor O
to O
promote O
public O
frugality O
as O
one O
means O
to O
lessen O
the O
publick O
debt O
. O

You O
will O
join O
in O
any O
proposals O
which O
may O
be O
made O
for O
the O
better O
cultivating O
the O
lands O
, O
and O
improving O
the O
husbandry O
of O
the O
province B-Location
: O
and O
as O
you O
represent O
a O
town O
which O
lives O
by O
its O
trade O
, O
we O
expect O
in O
a O
very O
particular O
manner O
, O
that O
you O
make O
it O
the O
object O
of O
your O
attention O
, O
to O
support O
our O
commerce O
in O
all O
its O
just O
rights O
, O
to O
vindicate O
it O
from O
all O
unreasonable O
impositions O
, O
and O
promote O
its O
prosperity—Our O
trade O
has O
for O
a O
long O
time O
laboured O
under O
great O
discouragements O
; O
and O
it O
is O
with O
the O
deepest O
concern O
that O
we O
see O
such O
further O
difficulties O
coming O
upon O
it O
, O
as O
will O
reduce O
it O
to O
the O
lowest O
ebb O
, O
if O
not O
totally O
obstruct O
and O
ruin O
it O
. O

We O
cannot O
help O
expressing O
our O
surprize O
that O
when O
so O
early O
notice O
was O
given O
by O
the O
agent O
, O
of O
the O
intentions O
of O
the O
ministry B-Organization
, O
to O
burthen O
us O
with O
new O
taxes O
, O
so O
little O
regard O
was O
had O
to O
this O
most O
interesting O
matter O
, O
that O
the O
court B-Organization
was O
not O
even O
call O
’ O
d O
together O
to O
consult O
about O
it O
’ O
till O
the O
latter O
end O
of O
the O
year O
; O
the O
consequence O
of O
which O
was O
, O
that O
instructions O
could O
not O
be O
sent O
to O
the O
agent O
, O
tho O
’ O
sollicited O
by O
him O
, O
’ O
till O
the O
evil O
had O
got O
beyond O
an O
easy O
remedy O
. O

There O
is O
now O
no O
room O
for O
further O
delay O
: O
We O
therefore O
expect O
that O
you O
will O
use O
your O
earliest O
endeavours O
in O
the O
General B-Organization
Assembly I-Organization
, O
that O
such O
methods O
may O
be O
taken O
as O
will O
effectually O
prevent O
these O
proceedings O
against O
us O
. O

By O
a O
proper O
representation O
, O
we O
apprehend O
it O
may O
easily O
be O
made O
to O
appear O
that O
such O
severities O
will O
prove O
detrimental O
to O
Great B-Organization
Britain I-Organization
itself O
; O
upon O
which O
account O
we O
have O
reason O
to O
hope O
that O
an O
application O
, O
even O
for O
a O
repeal O
of O
the O
act O
, O
should O
it O
be O
already O
pass O
’ O
d O
, O
will O
be O
successful O
. O

It O
is O
the O
trade O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
that O
renders O
them O
beneficial O
to O
the O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
: O
Our O
trade O
, O
as O
it O
is O
now O
, O
and O
always O
has O
been O
conducted O
, O
centers O
in O
Great B-Location
Britain I-Location
, O
and O
in O
return O
for O
her O
manufactures O
, O
affords O
her O
more O
ready O
cash O
, O
beyond O
any O
comparison O
, O
than O
can O
possibly O
be O
expected O
by O
the O
most O
sanguine O
promoters O
of O
these O
extraordinary O
methods O
. O

We O
are O
in O
short O
ultimately O
yielding O
large O
supplies O
to O
the O
revenues O
of O
the O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
, O
while O
we O
are O
labouring O
for O
a O
very O
moderate O
subsistence O
for O
ourselves O
. O

But O
if O
our O
trade O
is O
to O
be O
curtail O
’ O
d O
in O
its O
most O
profitable O
branches O
, O
and O
burdens O
beyond O
all O
possible O
bearing O
laid O
upon O
that O
which O
is O
suffer O
’ O
d O
to O
remain O
, O
we O
shall O
be O
so O
far O
from O
being O
able O
to O
take O
off O
the O
manufactures O
of O
Great B-Location
Britain I-Location
, O
that O
it O
will O
be O
scarce O
possible O
for O
us O
to O
earn O
our O
bread O
. O
— O
But O
what O
still O
heightens O
our O
apprehensions O
is O
, O
that O
these O
unexpected O
proceedings O
may O
be O
preparatory O
to O
new O
taxations O
upon O
us O
: O
For O
if O
our O
trade O
may O
be O
taxed O
, O
why O
not O
our O
lands O
? O

Why O
not O
the O
produce O
of O
our O
lands O
, O
and O
every O
thing O
we O
possess O
or O
make O
use O
of O
? O

This O
we O
apprehend O
annihilates O
our O
charter O
right O
to O
govern O
and O
tax O
ourselves—It O
strikes O
at O
our O
British O
privileges O
, O
which O
as O
we O
have O
never O
forfeited O
them O
, O
we O
hold O
in O
common O
with O
our O
fellow O
subjects O
who O
are O
natives O
of O
Britain B-Location
: O
If O
taxes O
are O
laid O
upon O
us O
in O
any O
shape O
without O
our O
having O
a O
legal O
representation O
where O
they O
are O
laid O
, O
are O
we O
not O
reduc O
’ O
d O
from O
the O
character O
of O
free O
subjects O
to O
the O
miserable O
state O
of O
tributary O
slaves O
? O

We O
therefore O
earnestly O
recommend O
it O
to O
you O
to O
use O
your O
utmost O
endeavors O
, O
to O
obtain O
in O

all O

instruction O

to O

THE O
publick O

to O
the O

may O
be O
considered O
as O
one O

struggle O
between O
the O

the O
people O
, O
all O
tending O
to O
that O
happy O
establishment O
, O
which O
Great-Britain B-Person
has O
since O
enjoyed O
. O

The O
absolute O
rights O
of O
Englishmen O
, O
as O
frequently O
declared O
in O
parliament B-Organization
, O
from O
Magna O
Charta O
, O
to O
this O
time O
, O
are O
the O
rights O
of O
personal O
security O
, O
personal O
liberty O
, O
and O
of O
private O
property O
. O

The O
allegiance O
of O
British O
subjects O
being O
natural O
, O
perpetual O
and O
inseparable O
from O
their O
persons O
, O
let O
them O
be O
in O
what O
country O
they O
may O
; O
their O
rights O
are O
also O
natural O
, O
inherent O
and O
perpetual O

By O
the O
laws O
of O
nature O
and O
of O
nations O
, O
the O
voice O
of O
universal O
reason O

and O
of O
God O

when O
a O
nation O
takes O
possession O
of O
a O
desert O
, O
uncultivated O
and O
uninhabited O
country O
, O
or O
purchases O
of O
Savages O
, O
as O
was O
the O
case O
with O
far O
the O
greatest O
part O
of O
the O
British O
settlements O
; O
the O
colonists O
transplanting O
themselves O

posterity O

intitled O
to O
all O
the O
essential O
rights O
of O
the O
mother O
country O

This O
is O
not O
only O
confirmed O
by O
the O
practice O
of O
the O
antients O

by O
the O
moderns O
ever O
since O
the O
discovery O

Frenchmen O

Spaniards O

been O
as O
free O
on O
one O
side O
of O
the O
atlantic O
as O
on O
the O

And O
it O
is O
humbly O
hoped O
that O
his O
Majesty B-Organization

the O
Parliament B-Organization

will O
in O
their O
wisdom O
be O
graciously O
pleased O
to O
continue O
the O
colonists O
in O
this O
happy O
state O
. O

It O
is O
presumed O
, O
that O
upon O
these O
principles O
, O
the O
colonists O
have O
been O
by O
their O
several O
charters O
declared O
natural O
subjects O
, O
and O
entrusted O
with O
the O
power O
of O
making O
their O
own O
local O
laws O
, O
not O
repugnant O
to O
the O
laws O
of O
England B-Organization
, O
and O
with O
the O
power O
of O
taxing O
themselves O
. O

This O
legislative O
power O
is O
subject O
by O
the O
same O
charter O
to O
the O
King B-Organization

negative O
as O

to O
the O

of O

It O
is O
contrary O
to O
reason O
that O
the O
supreme B-Organization
power I-Organization
should O
have O
right O
to O
alter O
the O

This O
would O
imply O
that O
those O

instructed O
with O
Sovereignty O
by O
the O
people O
, O
have O
a O
right O
to O
do O

they O

In O

that O

This O
is O
not O
very O
remote O
from O
a O
flat O
contradiction O

Should O
the O
parliament B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great-Britain I-Organization
follow O
the O
example O
of O
some O
other O
foreign O
states O
, O
26 O
and O
vote O
the O
King B-Organization
absolute O
and O
despotic O
; O
would O
such O
an O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
make O
him O
so O
? O

Would O
any O
minister O
in O
his O
senses O
advise O
a O
Prince O
to O
accept O
of O
such O
an O
offer O
of O
power O
? O

It O
would O
be O
unsafe O
to O
accept O
of O
such O
a O
donation O
, O
because O
the O
parliament B-Organization
or O
donors O
would O
grant O
more O
than O
was O
ever O
in O
their O
power O
lawfully O
to O
give O

The O
law O
of O
nature O
never O
invested O
them O
with O
a O
power O
of O
surrendering O
their O
own O
liberty O
; O

the O

certainly O
never O

It O
is O
now O
near O
three O
hundred O
years O
since O
the O

None O
of O
those O

that O

to O
equal O
priviledges O

British B-Organization
America I-Organization
has O
been O
hitherto O
distinguished O
from O
the O
slavish O
colonies O
around O
about O
it O
, O
as O
the O
fortunate O
Britons O
have O
been O
from O
most O
of O
their O
neighbours O
on O
the O
continent O
of O
Europe B-Location
. O

It O
is O
for O
the O
interest O
of O
GreatBritain B-Organization
that O
her O
colonies B-Organization
should O
be O
ever O
thus O
distinguished O
. O

Every O
man O
must O
wilfully O
blind O
himself O
that O
don O
’ O
t O
see O
the O
immense O
value O
of O
our O
acquisitions O
in O
the O
late O
war O
; O
and O
that O
tho O
’ O
we O
did O
not O
retain O
all O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
peace O
that O
we O
obtained O
by O
the O
sword O
; O
yet O
our O
gracious O
Sovereign B-Organization
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
that O
he O
has O
given O
a O
divine O
lesson O
of O
equitable O
moderation O
to O
the O
Princes B-Organization
of O
the O
earth O
, O
has O
retained O
sufficient O
to O
make O
the O
British O
arms O
the O
dread O
of O
the O
universe O
, O
and O
his O
name O
dear O
to O
all O
posterity O
. O

To O
the O
freedom O
of O
the O
British O
constitution O
, O
and O
to O
their O
increase O
of O
commerce O
, O
’ O
tis O
owing O
that O
our O
colonies B-Organization
have O
flourished O
without O
diminishing O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
; O
quite O
contrary O
to O
the O
effects O
of O
plantations O
made O
by O
most O
other O
nations O
, O
which O
have O
suffered O
at O
home O
, O
in O
order O
to O
aggrandize O
themselves O
abroad O
. O

This O
is O
remarkably O
the O
case O
with O
Spain B-Organization
. O

The O
subjects O
of O
a O
free O
and O
happy O
constitution O
of O
government O
, O
have O
a O
thousand O
advantages O
to O
colonize O
above O
those O
who O
live O
under O
despotic O
princes O
. O

We O
see O
how O
the O
British B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
on O
the O
continent B-Location
, O
have O
out-grown O
those O
of O
the O
French O
, O
notwithstanding O
they O
have O
ever O
engaged O
the O
Salvages O
to O
keep O
us O
back O
. O

Their O
advantages O
over O
us O
in O
the O
West-Indies B-Location
are O
, O
among O
other O
causes O
perhaps O
, O
partly O
owing O
to O
these O
, O
( O
1 O
. O
) O

A O
capital O
neglect O
in O
former O
reigns O
, O
in O
suffering O
them O
to O
have O
a O
firm O
possession O
of O
so O
many O
valuable O
islands O
, O
that O
we O
had O
a O
better O
title O
to O
than O
they O
. O
( O
2 O
. O
) O

The O
French O
unable O
to O
push O
their O
settlements O
effectually O
on O
the O
continent B-Location
, O
have O
bent O
their O
views O
to O
the O
islands B-Location
, O
and O
poured O
vast O
numbers O
into O
them O
. O
( O

. O
) O

The O
climate O
and O
business O
of O
these O
islands B-Location
is O
by O
nature O
much O
better O
adapted O
to O
Frenchmen O
and O
to O
Negroes O
, O
than O
to O
Britons O
. O
( O

) O

The O
labour O
of O
slaves O
, O
black O
or O
white O
, O
will O
be O
ever O
cheaper O
than O
that O
of O
freemen O
, O
because O
that O
of O
the O
individuals O
among O
the O
former O
, O
will O
never O
be O
worth O
so O
much O
as O
with O
the O
latter O
; O
but O
this O
difference O
is O
more O
than O
supplied O
; O
by O
numbers O
under O
the O
advantages O
abovementioned O
. O

The O
French O
will O
ever O
be O
able O
to O
sell O
their O
West-India O
produce O
cheaper O
than O
our O
own O
islanders O
; O
and O
yet O
while O
our O
own O
islanders O
can O
have O
such O
a O
price O
for O
theirs O
, O
as O
to O
grow O
much O
richer O
than O
the O
French O
, O
or O
any O
other O
of O
the O
King B-Organization
’ O
s O
subjects O
in O
America B-Location
, O
as O
is O
the O
case O
, O
and O
what O
the O
northern B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
take O
from O
the O
French B-Location
, O
and O
other O
foreign O
islands O
, O
centers O
finally O
in O
returns O
to O
Great-Britain B-Organization
for O
her O
manufactures O
, O
to O
an O
immense O
value O
, O
and O
with O
a O
vast O
profit O
to O
her O
: O
It O
is O
contrary O
to O
the O
first O
principles O
of O
policy O
to O
clog O
such O
a O
trade O
with O
duties O
, O
much O
more O
to O
prohibit O
it O
, O
to O
the O
risque O
if O
not O
certain O
destruction O
of O
the O
fishery O
. O

It O
is O
allowed O
by O
the O
most O
accurate O
British O
writers O
on O
commerce O
, O
Mr B-Person
. I-Person
Postlethwait I-Person
in O
particular O
, O
who O
seems O
to O
favour O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
sugar B-Location
islands I-Location
, O
that O
one O
half O
of O
the O
immense O
commerce O
of O
Great-Britain B-Organization
is O
with O
her O
colonies B-Location
. O

It O
is O
very O
certain O
that O
without O
the O
fishery O
seven O
eights O
of O
this O
commerce O
would O
cease O
. O

The O
fishery O
is O
the O
center O
of O
motion O
, O
upon O
which O
the O
wheel O
of O
all O
the O
British O
commerce O
in O
America B-Location
turns O
. O

Without O
the O
American O
trade O
, O
would O
Britain B-Organization
, O
as O
a O
commercial O
state O
, O
make O
any O
great O
figure O
at O
this O
day O
in O
Europe B-Location
? O

Her O
trade O
in O
woolen O
and O
other O
manufactures O
, O
is O
said O
to O
be O
lessening O
in O
all O
parts O
of O
the O
world O
, O
but O
America B-Location
, O
where O
it O
is O
increasing O
, O
and O
capable O
of O
infinite O
increase O
, O
from O
a O
concurrence O
of O
every O
circumstance O
in O
its O
favour O
. O

Here O
is O
an O
extensive O
territory O
of O
different O
climates O
, O
which O
in O
time O
will O
consume O
, O
and O
be O
able O
to O
pay O
for O
as O
many O
manufactures O
as O
Great-Britain B-Location
and O
Ireland B-Location
can O
make O
, O
if O
true O
maxims O
are O
persued O
. O

The O
French O
for O
reasons O
already O
mentioned O
, O
can O
underwork O
, O
and O
consequently O
undersell O
the O
English O
manufactures O
of O
GreatBritain B-Location
in O
every O
market O
in O
Europe B-Location
. O

But O
they O
can O
send O
none O
of O
their O
manufactures O
here O
; O
and O
it O
is O
the O
wish O
of O
every O
honest O
British O
American O
that O
they O
never O
may O
; O
’ O
tis O
best O
they O
never O
should O
; O
we O
can O
do O
better O
without O
the O
manufactures O
of O
Europe B-Location
, O
save O
those O
of O
Great-Britain B-Location
, O
than O
with O
them O
: O
But O
without O
the O
French O
West-India O
produce O
we O
cannot O
; O
without O
it O
our O
fishery O
must O
infallibly O
be O
ruined O
. O

When O
that O
is O
gone O
our O
own O
islands B-Organization
will O
very O
poorly O
subsist O
. O

No O
British O
manufactures O
can O
be O
paid O
for O
by O
the O
colonists O
. O

What O
will O
follow O
? O

One O
of O
these O
two O
things O
, O
both O
of O
which O
it O
is O
the O
interest O
of O
Great-Britain B-Organization
to O
prevent O
. O
( O
1 O
. O
) O

The O
northern O
colonists O
must O
be O
content O
to O
go O
naked O
, O
and O
turn O
Savages O
. O

Or O
( O

) O

Become O
manufacturers O
of O
linnen O
and O
woolen O
, O
to O
cloath O
themselves O
; O
which O
if O
they O
cannot O
carry O
to O
the O
perfection O
of O
Europe B-Location
, O
will O
be O
very O
destructive O
to O
the O
interests O
of O
Great-Britain B-Organization
. O

The O
computation O
has O
been O
made O
, O
and O
that O
within O
bounds O
, O
and O
it O
can O
be O
demonstrated O
, O
that O
if O
North-America B-Organization
is O
only O
driven O
to O
the O
fatal O
necessity O
of O
manufacturing O
a O
suit O
of O
the O
most O
ordinary O
linnen O
or O
woolen O
for O
each O
inhabitant O
annually O
, O
which O
may O
be O
soon O
done O
, O
when O
necessity O
the O
mother O
of O
invention O
shall O
operate O
, O
Great-Britain B-Organization
& O
Ireland B-Organization
will O
loose O
two O
millions O
per O
annum O
, O
besides O
a O
diminution O
of O
the O
revenue O
to O
nearly O
the O
same O
amount O
. O

This O
may O
appear O
paradoxical O
, O
but O
a O
few O
years O
experience O
of O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
sugar O
act O
, O
will O
sufficiently O
convince O
the O
parliament B-Organization
not O
only O
of O
the O
inutility O
, O
but O
destructive O
tendency O
of O
it O
, O
while O
calculations O
may O
be O
little O
attended O
to O
. O

That O
the O
trade O
with O
the O
colonies B-Organization
has O
been O
of O
surprizing O
advantage O
to O
Great-Britain B-Organization
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
want O
of O
a O
good O
regulation O
is O
past O
all O
doubt O
. O

Great-Britain B-Organization
is O
well O
known O
to O
have O
increased O
prodigiously O
both O
in O
numbers O
and O
in O
wealth O
since O
she O
began O
to O
colonize O
. O

To O
the O
growth O
of O
the O
plantations B-Organization
Britain B-Organization
is O
in O
a O
great O
measure O
indebted O
for O
her O
present O
riches O
and O
strength O
. O

As O
the O
wild O
wastes O
of O
America B-Location
have O
been O
turned O
into O
pleasant O
habitations O
, O
and O
flourishing O
trading O
towns O
; O
so O
many O
of O
the O
little O
villages O
and O
obscure O
boroughs O
in O
Great-Britain B-Location
have O
put O
on O
a O
new O
face O
, O
and O
suddenly O
started O
up O
, O
and O
become O
fair O
markets O
, O
and O
manufacturing O
towns O
, O
and O
opulent O
cities O
. O

London B-Location
itself O
, O
which O
bids O
fair O
to O
be O
the O
metropolis O
of O
the O
world O
, O
is O
five O
times O
more O
populous O
than O
it O
was O
in O
the O
days O
of O
Queen B-Person
Elizabeth I-Person
. O

Such O
are O
the O
fruits O
of O
the O
spirit O
of O
commerce O
and O
liberty O
. O

Hence O
it O
is O
manifest O
how O
much O
we O
all O
owe O
to O
that O
beautiful O
form O
of O
civil O
government O
, O
under O
which O
we O
have O
the O
happiness O
to O
live O
. O

It O
is O
evidently O
the O
interest O
, O
and O
ought O
to O
be O
the O
care O
of O
all O
those O
intrusted O
with O
the O
administration O
of O
government O
, O
to O
see O
that O
every O
part O
of O
the O
British B-Organization
empire I-Organization
enjoys O
to O
the O
full O
the O
rights O
they O
are O
intitled O
to O
by O
the O
laws O
, O
and O
the O
advantages O
which O
result O
from O
their O
being O
maintained O
with O
impartiality O
and O
vigour O
. O

This O
we O
have O
seen O
reduced O
to O
practice O
in O
the O
present O
and O
preceeding O
reigns O
; O
and O
have O
the O
highest O
reason O
from O
the O
paternal O
care O
and O
goodness O
that O
his O
Majesty B-Person
, O
and O
the O
British B-Organization
Parliament I-Organization
, O
have O
hitherto O
been O
graciously O
pleased O
to O
discover O
to O
all O
his O
Majesty B-Person
’ O
s O
dutiful O
and O
loyal O
subjects O
, O
and O
to O
the O
colonists O
in O
particular O
, O
to O
rest O
satisfied O
, O
that O
our O
priviledges O
will O
remain O
sacred O
and O
inviolate O
. O

The O
connection O
between O
Great-Britain B-Organization
and O
her O
colonies B-Organization
is O
so O
natural O
and O
strong O
, O
as O
to O
make O
their O
mutual O
happiness O
depend O
upon O
their O
mutual O
support O
. O

Nothing O
can O
tend O
more O
to O
the O
destruction O
of O
both O
, O
and O
to O
forward O
the O
measures O
of O
their O
enemies O
, O
than O
sowing O
the O
seeds O
of O
jealousy O
, O
animosity O
and O
dissention O
between O
the O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
and O
the O
colonies B-Organization
. O

A O
conviction O
of O
the O
truth O
and O
importance O
of O
these O
principles O
, O
induced O
Great-Britain B-Organization
during O
the O
late O
war O
, O
to O
carry O
on O
so O
many O
glorious O
enterprizes O
for O
the O
defence O
of O
the O
colonies B-Location
; O
and O
those O
on O
their O
part O
to O
exert O
themselves O
beyond O
their O
ability O
to O
pay O
, O
as O
is O
evident O
from O
the O
parliamentary O
reimbursements O
. O

If O
the O
spirit O
of O
commerce O
was O
attended O
to O
, O
perhaps O
, O
duties O
would O
be O
every O
where O
decreased O
, O
if O
not O
annihilated O
, O
and O
prohibitions O
multiplied O
. O

Every O
branch O
of O
trade O
that O
hurts O
a O
community O
, O
should O
be O
prohibited O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
that O
a O
private O
gentleman O
would O
break O
off O
commerce O
with O
a O
sharper O
or O
an O
extorsive O
usurer O
. O
’ O
Tis O
to O
no O
purpose O
to O
higgle O
with O
such O
people O
, O
you O
are O
sure O
to O
loose O
by O
them O
. O
’ O
Tis O
exactly O
so O
with O
a O
nation O
, O
if O
the O
balance O
is O
against O
them O
, O
and O
they O
can O
possibly O
subsist O
without O
the O
commodity O
, O
as O
they O
generally O
can O
in O
such O
cases O
, O
a O
prohibition O
is O
the O
only O
remedy O
; O
for O
a O
duty O
in O
such O
case O
, O
is O
like O
a O
composition O
with O
a O
thief O
, O
that O
for O
five O
shillings O
in O
the O
pound O
returned O
, O
he O
shall O
rob O
you O
at O
pleasure O
; O
when O
if O
the O
thing O
is O
examined O
to O
the O
bottom O
, O
you O
are O
at O
five O
shillings O
expence O
in O
travelling O
to O
get O
back O
your O
five O
shillings O
, O
and O
he O
is O
at O
the O
same O
expence O
in O
coming O
to O
pay O
it O
, O
so O
he O
robs O
you O
of O
but O
ten O
shillings O
in O
the O
pound O
, O
that O
you O

To O
apply O
this O
to O

, O
I O
believe O
every O
duty O
that O
was O
ever O
imposed O
on O
commerce O
, O
or O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
things O
can O
be O
, O
will O
be O
found O
to O
be O
divided O
between O
the O
state O
imposing O
the O
duty O
, O
and O
the O
country O
exported O
from O
. O

This O
if O
between O
the O
several O
parts O
of O
the O
same O
kingdom O
or O
dominions O
of O
the O
same O
Prince O
, O
can O
only O
tend O
to O
embarrass O
trade O
, O
and O
raise O
the O
price O
of O
labour O
above O
other O
states O
, O
which O
is O
of O
very O
pernicious O
consequence O
to O
the O
husbandman O
, O
manufacturer O
, O
mariner O
and O
merchant O
, O
the O
four O
tribes O
that O
support O
the O
whole O
hive O

If O
your O
duty O
is O
upon O
a O
commodity O
of O
a O
foreign O
state O
, O
it O
is O
either O
upon O
the O
whole O
useful O
and O
gainful O
, O
and O
therefore O
necessary O
for O
the O
husbandmen O
, O
manufacturer O
, O
mariner O
or O
merchant O
, O
as O
finally O
bringing O
a O
profit O
to O
the O
state O
by O
a O
balance O
in O
her O
favour O
; O
or O
the O
importation O
will O
work O
a O
balance O
against O
your O
state O
. O

There O
is O
no O
medium O
that O
we O
know O
of O
. O

— O
If O
the O
commodity O
is O
of O
the O
former O
kind O
, O
it O
should O
be O
prohibited O
; O
but O
if O
the O
latter O
, O
imported O
duty O
free O
, O
unless O
you O
would O
raise O
the O
price O
of O
labour O
by O
a O
duty O
on O
necessaries O
, O
or O
make O
the O
above O
wise O
composition O
for O
the O
importation O
of O
commodities O
you O
are O
sure O
to O
lose O
by O
. O

The O
only O
test O
of O
a O
useful O
commodity O
is O
the O
gain O
upon O
the O
whole O
to O
the O
state O
; O
such O
should O
be O
free O
; O
the O
only O
test O
of O
a O
pernicious O
trade O
is O
the O
loss O
upon O
the O
whole O
, O
or O
to O
the O
community O
, O
this O
should O
be O
prohibited O
. O

If O
therefore O
it O
can O
be O
demonstrated O
that O
the O
sugar O
and O
molasses O
trade O
from O
the O
northern B-Location
colonies I-Location
to O
the O
foreign O
plantations B-Location
is O
upon O
the O
whole O
a O
loss O
to O
the O
community O
, O
by O
which O
term O
is O
here O
meant O
the O
three B-Location
kingdoms I-Location
and O
the O
British B-Location
dominions I-Location
taken O
collectively O
, O
then O
and O
not O
’ O
till O
then O
should O
this O
trade O
be O
prohibited O
. O

This O
never O
has O
been O
proved O
, O
nor O
can O
be O
; O
the O
contrary O
being O
certain O
, O
to O
wit O
, O
that O
the O
nation B-Organization
upon O
the O
whole O
hath O
been O
a O
vast O
gainer O
by O
this O
trade O
, O
in O
the O
vend O
of O
and O
pay O
for O
its O
manufactures O
; O
and O
a O
great O
loss O
by O
a O
duty O
upon O
this O
trade O
will O
finally O
fall O
on O
the O
British O
husbandman O
, O
manufacturer O
, O
mariner O
& O
merchant O
, O
and O
consequently O
the O
trade O
of O
the O
nation B-Organization
be O
wounded O
, O
and O
in O
constant O
danger O
of O
being O
eat O
out O
by O
those O
who O
can O
undersell O
her O
. O

The O
art O
of O
underselling O
, O
or O
rather O
of O
finding O
means O
to O
undersell O
, O
is O
the O
grand O
secret O
of O
thrift O
among O
commercial O
states O
, O
as O
well O
as O
among O
individuals O
of O
the O
same O
state O
. O

Should O
the O
British B-Location
sugar I-Location
islands I-Location
ever O
be O
able O
to O
supply O
Great-Britain B-Organization
and O
her O
northern B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
with O
those O
articles O
, O
it O
will O
be O
time O
enough O
to O
think O
of O
a O
total O
prohibition O
; O
but O
until O
that O
time O
, O
both O
prohibition O
and O
duty O
will O
be O
found O
to O
be O
diametrically O
opposite O
to O
the O
first O
principles O
of O
policy O
. O

Such O
is O
the O
extent O
of O
this O
continent B-Location
, O
and O
the O
increase O
of O
its O
inhabitants O
, O
that O
if O
every O
inch O
of O
the O
British B-Location
sugar I-Location
islands I-Location
was O
as O
well O
cultivated O
as O
any O
part O
of O
Jamaica B-Location
, O
or O
Barbadoes B-Location
, O
they O
would O
not O
now O
be O
able O
to O
supply O
Great-Britain B-Organization
, O
and O
the O
colonies B-Organization
on O
this O
continent B-Location
. O

But O
before O
such O
further O
improvements O
can O
be O
supposed O
to O
take O
place O
in O
our O
islands B-Location
, O
the O
demands O
will O
be O
proportionably O
increased O
by O
the O
increase O
of O
the O
inhabitants O
on O
the O
continent B-Location
. O

Hence O
the O
reason O
is O
plain O
why O
the O
British O
sugar O
planters O
are O
growing O
rich O
, O
and O
ever O
will O
, O
because O
the O
demand O
for O
their O
produce O
has O
and O
ever O
will O
be O
greater O
than O
they O
can O
possibly O
supply O
, O
so O
long O
as O
the O
English O
hold O
this O
continent B-Location
, O
and O
are O
unrivalled O
in O
the O
fishery O

Sovereign B-Organization

and O

that O
when O

of O

very O
important O
question O
here O
presents O
itself O
. O

It O
essentially O
belongs O
to O
the O
society O
to O
make O
laws O
both O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
it O
desires O
to O
be O
governed O
, O
and O
to O
the O
conduct O
of O
the O
citizens O
: O
This O
is O
called O
the O
Legislative O
Power O
. O

The O
nation O
may O
entrust O
the O
exercise O
of O
it O
to O
the O
Prince O
, O
or O
to O
an O
assembly O
; O
or O
to O
the O
assembly O
and O
the O
Prince O
jointly O
; O
who O
have O
then O
a O
right O
of O
making O
new O
, O
and O
abrogating O
old O
laws O
. O

It O
is O
here O
demanded O
whether O
, O
if O
their O
power O
extends O
so O
far O
as O
to O
the O
fundamental O
laws O
, O
they O
may O
change O
the O
constitution O
of O
the O
state O
? O

The O
principles O
we O
have O
laid O
down O
lead O
us O
to O
decide O
this O
point O
with O
certainty O
, O
that O
the O
authority O
of O
these O
legislators O
does O
not O
extend O
so O
far O
, O
and O
that O
they O
ought O
to O
consider O
the O
fundamental O
laws O
as O
sacred O
, O
if O
the O
nation O
has O
not O
in O
very O
express O
terms O
given O
them O
the O
power O
to O
change O
them O
. O

For O
the O
constitution O
of O
the O
state O
ought O
to O
be O
fixed O
; O
and O
since O
that O
was O
first O
established O
by O
the O
nation O
, O
which O
afterwards O
trusted O
certain O
persons O
with O
the O
legislative O
power O
, O
the O
fundamental O
laws O
are O
excepted O
from O
their O
commission O
. O

It O
appears O
that O
the O
society O
had O
only O
resolved O
to O
make O
provision O
for O
the O
state O
’ O
s O
being O
always O
furnished O
with O
laws O
suited O
to O
particular O
conjunctures O
, O
and O
gave O
the O
legislature O
for O
that O
purpose O
, O
the O
power O
of O
abrogating O
the O
ancient O
civil O
and O
political O
laws O
, O
that O
were O
not O
fundamental O
, O
and O
of O
making O
new O
ones O
: O
But O
nothing O
leads O
us O
to O
think O
that O
it O
was O
willing O
to O
submit O
the O
constitution O
itself O
to O
their O
pleasure O
. O

When O
a O
nation O
takes O
possession O
of O
a O
distant O
country O
, O
and O
settles O
a O
colony O
there O
, O
that O
country O
though O
separated O
from O
the O
principal O
establishment O
, O
or O
mother O
country O
, O
naturally O
becomes O
a O
part O
of O
the O
state O
, O
equally O
with O
its O
ancient O
possessions O
. O

Whenever O
the O
political O
laws O
, O
or O
treaties O
make O
no O
distinction O
between O
them O
, O
every O
thing O
said O
of O
the O
territory O
of O
a O
nation O
, O
ought O
also O
to O
extend O
to O
its O
colonies O

if O

What O
are O
his O
rights O
over O
the O

Some O
have O
dared O
to O
advance O
this O
monstrous O
principle O
, O
that O
the O
conqueror O
is O
absolute O
master O
of O
his O
conquest O
; O
that O
he O
may O
dispose O
of O
it O

according O

who O
deliver O
them O
up O
as O
the O
property O

of O
another O
man O
. O

Let O
us O
argue O
on O
principles O
countenanced O
by O
reason O
and O
becoming O
humanity O
. O

The O
whole O
right O
of O
the O
conqueror O
proceeds O
from O
the O
just O
defence O
of O
himself O
, O
which O
contains O
the O
support O
and O
prosecution O
of O
his O
rights O
. O

Thus O
when O
he O
has O
totally O
subdued O
a O
nation O
with O
whom O
he O
had O
been O
at O
war O
, O
he O
may O
without O
dispute O
cause O
justice O
to O
be O
done O
him O
, O
with O
regard O
to O
what O
gave O
rise O
to O
the O
war O
, O
and O
require O
payment O
for O
the O
expence O
and O
damage O
he O
has O
sustained O
; O
he O
may O
according O
to O
the O
exigency O
of O
the O
case O
impose O
penalties O
on O
it O
as O
an O
example O
, O
he O
may O
should O
prudence O
so O
dictate O
disable O
it O
from O
undertaking O
any O
pernicious O
designs O
for O
the O
future O
. O

But O
in O
securing O
all O
these O
views O
the O
mildest O
means O
are O
to O
be O
preferred O
. O

We O
are O
always O
to O
remember O
, O
that O
the O
law O
of O
nature O
permits O
no O
injury O
to O
be O
done O
to O
an O

unless O

measures O

a O
