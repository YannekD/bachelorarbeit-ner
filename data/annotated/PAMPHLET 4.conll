Resistance O
to O
imperial O
reforms O
emerged O
early O
and O
with O
special O
intensity O
in O
Rhode B-Location
Island I-Location
, O
a O
colony O
notorious O
for O
its O
rampant O
smuggling O
and O
extremely O
democratic O
or O
, O
in O
the O
parlance O
of O
the O
day O
, O
popular O
character O
. O

With O
Rhode B-Organization
Island I-Organization
’ I-Organization
s I-Organization
governor I-Organization
and O
council B-Organization
being O
elected O
annually O
and O
the O
Assembly B-Organization
elected O
twice O
a O
year O
, O
the O
colony O
was O
continually O
racked O
by O
something O
resembling O
modern O
party O
politics O
. O

For O
decades O
two O
rival O
factions O
vied O
for O
control O
of O
the O
government B-Organization
, O
using O
every O
weapon O
they O
could O
, O
including O
bribery O
, O
name-calling O
, O
party O
trickery O
, O
and O
corruption O
. O

So O
commercially O
minded O
were O
the O
colony B-Location
’ O
s O
farmers O
that O
between O
1710 O
and O
1751 O
they O
had O
pressured O
the O
Assembly B-Organization
to O
pass O
no O
less O
than O
nine O
paper O
money O
emissions O
, O
precipitating O
Parliament B-Organization
’ O
s O
intervention O
with O
the O
Currency O
Act O
of O
1751 O
that O
forbade O
the O
New B-Organization
England I-Organization
colonies I-Organization
from O
making O
paper O
money O
legal O
tender O
. O

And O
so O
jealous O
of O
one O
another O
were O
Rhode O
Islanders O
that O
their O
capital O
had O
to O
be O
rotated O
among O
five O
different O
towns O
. O

Stephen B-Person
Hopkins I-Person
, O
governor B-Organization
of I-Organization
Rhode I-Organization
Island I-Organization
and O
leader O
of O
the O
colony B-Organization
’ O
s O
more O
popular O
faction O
, O
wrote O
this O
pamphlet O
in O
November O
1764 O
and O
published O
it O
shortly O
thereafter O
with O
the O
endorsement O
of O
the O
colony B-Organization
’ I-Organization
s I-Organization
Assembly I-Organization
. O

Although O
Hopkins B-Person
had O
no O
formal O
schooling O
, O
he O
was O
a O
voracious O
reader O
, O
something O
he O
was O
eager O
to O
display O
in O
his O
pamphlet O
. O

Lacking O
Otis B-Person
’ O
s O
sophistication O
and O
learning O
, O
Hopkins B-Person
set O
forth O
his O
opposition O
to O
the O
Sugar O
Act O
, O
the O
new O
trade O
regulations O
, O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
stamp O
tax O
( O
which O
had O
been O
announced O
in O
the O
text O
of O
the O
Sugar O
Act O
) O
in O
a O
much O
more O
blunt O
manner O
than O
Otis B-Person
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
his O
pamphlet O
had O
its O
own O
ambiguities O
. O

Hopkins B-Person
admitted O
that O
the O
colonies B-Organization
were O
dependent O
on O
Great B-Organization
Britain I-Organization
, O
and O
that O
it O
was O
“ O
the O
indespensable O
duty O
of O
every O
good O
and O
loyal O
subject O
, O
chearfully O
to O
obey O
” O
the O
laws O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
. O

Yet O
at O
the O
same O
time O
he O
insisted O
that O
Parliament B-Organization
’ O
s O
taxing O
of O
the O
colonies B-Location
would O
be O
tantamount O
to O
turning O
the O
Americans O
into O
slaves O
. O

But O
what O
else O
Parliament B-Organization
could O
do O
in O
dealing O
with O
the O
local O
affairs O
of O
dependent B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
Hopkins B-Person
left O
open O
and O
unresolved O
. O

It O
never O
occurred O
to O
him O
, O
as O
it O
had O
to O
Otis B-Person
, O
that O
Parliament B-Organization
could O
be O
considered O
to O
be O
a O
court O
that O
would O
correct O
its O
own O
errors O
. O

Raising O
the O
possibility O
of O
colonial O
representation O
in O
Parliament B-Organization
, O
Hopkins B-Person
sidestepped O
that O
problem O
, O
and O
instead O
suggested O
that O
Americans O
might O
simply O
be O
kept O
informed O
in O
some O
way O
or O
another O
about O
Parliament B-Organization
’ O
s O
intentions O
toward O
America B-Organization
. O

Hopkins B-Person
’ O
s O
pamphlet O
was O
primitive O
and O
tentative O
in O
many O
respects O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
alone O
in O
his O
uncertainties O
. O

Few O
Americans O
as O
yet O
saw O
with O
any O
clarity O
how O
the O
authority O
between O
the O
colonies B-Organization
and O
the O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
might O
be O
divided O
. O

Liberty O
. O

L O
is O
the O
greatest O
blessing O
that O
men O
enjoy O
, O
and O
slavery O
the O
heaviest O
curse O
that O
human O
nature O
is O
capable O
of O
. O

— O
This O
being O
so O
, O
makes O
it O
a O
matter O
of O
the O
utmost O
importance O
to O
men O
, O
which O
of O
the O
two O
shall O
be O
their O
portion O
. O

Absolute O
Liberty O
is O
, O
perhaps O
, O
incompatible O
with O
any O
kind O
of O
government O
. O

— O
The O
safety O
resulting O
from O
society O
, O
and O
the O
advantage O
of O
just O
and O
equal O
laws O
, O
hath O
caused O
men O
to O
forego O
some O
part O
of O
their O
natural O
liberty O
, O
and O
submit O
to O
government O
. O

This O
appears O
to O
be O
the O
most O
rational O
account O
of O
it O
’ O
s O
beginning O
; O
although O
, O
it O
must O
be O
confessed O
, O
mankind O
have O
by O
no O
means O
been O
agreed O
about O
it O
: O
Some O
have O
found O
it O
’ O
s O
origin O
in O
the O
divine O
appointment O
: O
Others O
have O
thought O
it O
took O
it O
’ O
s O
rise O
from O
power O
: O
Enthusiasts O
have O
dreamed O
that O
dominion O
was O
founded O
in O
grace O
. O

Leaving O
these O
points O
to O
be O
settled O
by O
the O
descendants O
of O
Filmer B-Person
, O
Cromwell B-Person
, O
and O
Venner B-Person
, O
we O
will O
consider O
the O
British O
constitution O
, O
as O
it O
at O
present O
stands O
, O
on O
revolution O
principles O
; O
and O
from O
thence O
endeavour O
to O
find O
the O
measure O
of O
the O
magistrate O
’ O
s O
power O
, O
and O
the O
people O
’ O
s O
obedience O
. O

This O
glorious O
constitution O
, O
the O
best O
that O
ever O
existed O
among O
men O
, O
will O
be O
confessed O
by O
all O
, O
to O
be O
founded O
by O
compact O
, O
and O
established O
by O
consent O
of O
the O
people O
. O

By O
this O
most O
beneficent O
compact O
, O
British O
subjects O
are O
to O
be O
governed O
only O
agreeable O
to O
laws O
to O
which O
themselves O
have O
some O
way O
consented O
, O
and O
are O
not O
to O
be O
compelled O
to O
part O
with O
their O
property O
, O
but O
as O
it O
is O
called O
for O
by O
the O
authority O
of O
such O
laws O
: O
The O
former O
is O
truly O
liberty O
; O
the O
IBERTY O
latter O
is O
really O
to O
be O
possessed O
of O
property O
, O
and O
to O
have O
something O
that O
may O
be O
called O
one O
’ O
s O
own O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
those O
who O
are O
governed O
at O
the O
will O
of O
another O
, O
or O
of O
others O
, O
and O
whose O
property O
may O
be O
taken O
from O
them O
by O
taxes O
, O
or O
otherwise O
, O
without O
their O
own O
consent O
, O
and O
against O
their O
will O
, O
are O
in O
the O
miserable O
condition O
of O
slaves O
: O
“ O
For O
liberty O
solely O
consists O
in O
an O
independancy O
upon O
the O
will O
of O
another O
; O
and O
by O
the O
name O
of O
slave O
, O
we O
understand O
a O
man O
who O
can O
neither O
dispose O
of O
his O
person O
or O
goods O
, O
but O
enjoys O
all O
at O
the O
will O
of O
his O
master O
; O
” O
says O
Sidney B-Person
on O
government O
. O

These O
things O
premised O
; O
whether O
the O
British B-Organization
American I-Organization
colonies I-Organization
on O
the O
continent B-Location
, O
are O
justly O
intituled O
to O
like O
privileges O
and O
freedom O
as O
their O
fellow-subjects O
in O
Great-Britain B-Location
are O
, O
shall O
be O
the O
chief O
point O
examined O
. O

In O
discussing O
this O
question O
, O
we O
shall O
make O
the O
colonies B-Organization
in O
New-England B-Location
, O
with O
whose O
rights O
we O
are O
best O
acquainted O
, O
the O
rule O
of O
our O
reasoning O
; O
not O
in O
the O
least O
doubting O
but O
all O
the O
others O
are O
justly O
intituled O
to O
like O
rights O
with O
them O
. O

New-England B-Location
was O
first O
planted O
by O
adventurers O
, O
who O
left O
England B-Location
, O
their O
native O
country B-Location
, O
by O
permission O
of O
King B-Person
CHARLES I-Person
the I-Person
first I-Person
; O
and O
, O
at O
their O
own O
expence O
, O
transported O
themselves O
to O
America B-Location
, O
with O
great O
risque O
and O
difficulty O
settled O
among O
savages O
, O
and O
in O
a O
very O
surprising O
manner O
formed O
new O
colonies O
in O
the O
wilderness O
. O

Before O
their O
departure O
, O
the O
terms O
of O
their O
freedom O
, O
and O
the O
relation O
they O
should O
stand O
in O
to O
the O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
, O
in O
their O
emigrant O
state O
, O
were O
fully O
settled O
; O
they O
were O
to O
remain O
subject O
to O
the O
King B-Organization
, O
and O
dependant O
on O
the O
kingdom B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great-Britain I-Organization
. O

In O
return O
, O
they O
were O
to O
receive O
protection O
, O
and O
enjoy O
all O
the O
rights O
and O
privileges O
of O
free-born O
Englishmen O
. O

This O
is O
abundantly O
proved O
by O
the O
charter O
given O
to O
the O
Massachusetts B-Organization
colony I-Organization
, O
while O
they O
were O
still O
in O
England B-Location
, O
and O
which O
they O
received O
and O
brought O
over O
with O
them O
, O
as O
the O
authentic O
evidence O
of O
the O
conditions O
they O
removed O
upon O
. O

The O
colonies O
of O
Connecticut B-Organization
and O
Rhode-Island B-Organization
also O
, O
afterwards O
obtained O
charters O
from O
the O
crown B-Organization
, O
granting O
them O
the O
like O
ample O
privileges O
. O

By O
all O
these O
charters O
, O
it O
is O
in O
the O
most O
express O
and O
solemn O
manner O
granted O
, O
that O
these O
adventurers O
, O
and O
their O
children O
after O
them O
forever O
, O
should O
have O
and O
enjoy O
all O
the O
freedom O
and O
liberty O
that O
the O
subjects O
in O
England B-Location
enjoy O
: O
That O
they O
might O
make O
laws O
for O
their O
own O
government O
, O
suitable O
to O
their O
circumstances O
; O
not O
repugnant O
to O
, O
but O
as O
near O
as O
might O
be O
, O
agreeable O
to O
the O
laws O
of O
England B-Location
: O
That O
they O
might O
purchase O
lands O
, O
acquire O
goods O
, O
and O
use O
trade O
for O
their O
advantage O
, O
and O
have O
an O
absolute O
property O
in O
whatever O
they O
justly O
acquired O
. O

These O
, O
with O
many O
other O
gracious O
privileges O
, O
were O
granted O
them O
by O
several O
kings O
; O
and O
they O
were O
to O
pay O
as O
an O
acknowledgement O
to O
the O
crown B-Organization
, O
only O
one O
fifth O
part O
of O
the O
ore O
of O
gold O
and O
silver O
, O
that O
should O
at O
any O
time O
be O
found O
in O
the O
said O
colonies B-Location
, O
in O
lieu O
of O
, O
and O
full O
satisfaction O
for O
, O
all O
dues O
and O
demands O
of O
the O
crown B-Organization
and O
kingdom B-Organization
of I-Organization
England I-Organization
upon O
them O
. O

There O
is O
not O
any O
thing O
new O
or O
extraordinary O
in O
these O
rights O
granted O
to O
the O
British B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
: O
— O
The O
colonies O
from O
all O
countries O
, O
at O
all O
times O
, O
have O
enjoyed O
equal O
freedom O
with O
the O
mother O
state O
. O

Indeed O
, O
there O
would O
be O
found O
very O
few O
people O
in O
the O
world O
, O
willing O
to O
leave O
their O
native O
country O
, O
and O
go O
through O
the O
fatigue O
and O
hardship O
of O
planting O
in O
a O
new O
uncultivated O
one O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
losing O
their O
freedom O
. O

They O
who O
settle O
new O
countries O
must O
be O
poor O
; O
and O
, O
in O
course O
, O
ought O
to O
be O
free O
. O

Advantages O
, O
pecuniary O
or O
agreeable O
, O
are O
not O
on O
the O
side O
of O
emigrants O
, O
and O
surely O
they O
must O
have O
something O
in O
their O
stead O
. O

To O
illustrate O
this O
, O
permit O
us O
to O
examine O
what O
hath O
generally O
been O
the O
condition O
of O
colonies O
with O
respect O
to O
their O
freedom O
; O
we O
will O
begin O
with O
those O
who O
went O
out O
from O
the O
ancient B-Location
common-wealths I-Location
of I-Location
Greece I-Location
, O
which O
are O
the O
first O
, O
perhaps O
, O
we O
have O
any O
good O
account O
of O
. O

Thucidides B-Person
, O
that O
grave O
and O
judicious O
historian O
, O
says O
of O
one O
of O
them O
, O
“ O
they O
were O
not O
sent O
out O
to O
be O
slaves O
, O
but O
to O
be O
the O
equals O
of O
those O
who O
remain O
behind O
; O
” O
and O
again O
, O
the O
Corinthians O
gave O
public O
notice O
, O
“ O
that O
a O
new O
colony O
was O
going O
to O
Epidamnus B-Location
, O
into O
which O
all O
that O
would O
enter O
, O
should O
have O
equal O
and O
like O
privileges O
with O
those O
who O
staid O
at O
home O
. O
” O

This O
was O
uniformly O
the O
condition O
of O
all O
the O
Grecian B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
; O
they O
went O
out O
and O
settled O
new O
countries O
; O
they O
took O
such O
forms O
of O
government O
as O
themselves O
chose O
, O
though O
it O
generally O
nearly O
resembled O
that O
of O
the O
mother B-Organization
state I-Organization
, I-Organization
whether O
democratical O
or O
oligarchical O
. O
’ O
Tis O
true O
, O
they O
were O
fond O
to O
acknowledge O
their O
original O
, O
and O
always O
confessed O
themselves O
under O
obligation O
to O
pay O
a O
kind O
of O
honorary O
respect O
to O
, O
and O
shew O
a O
filial O
dependance O
on O
, O
the O
common-wealth B-Organization
from O
whence O
they O
sprung O
. O

Thucidides B-Person
again O
tells O
us O
, O
that O
the O
Corinthians O
complained O
of O
the O
Corcyreans O
, O
“ O
from O
whom O
, O
though O
a O
colony B-Organization
of O
their O
own O
, O
they O
had O
received O
some O
contemptuous O
treatment O
: O
for O
they O
neither O
payed O
them O
the O
usual O
honor O
on O
their O
public O
solemnities O
, O
nor O
began O
with O
a O
Corinthian O
in O
the O
distribution O
of O
the O
sacrifices O
, O
which O
is O
always O
done O
by O
other O
colonies O
. O
” O

From O
hence O
it O
is O
plain O
what O
kind O
of O
dependance O
the O
Greek B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
were O
under O
, O
and O
what O
sort O
of O
acknowledgment O
they O
owed O
to O
the O
mother B-Organization
state I-Organization
. O

If O
we O
pass O
from O
the O
Grecian B-Organization
to O
the O
Roman B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
, O
we O
shall O
find O
them O
not O
less O
free O
: O
But O
this O
difference O
may O
be O
observed O
between O
them O
, O
that O
the O
Roman B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
did O
not O
, O
like O
the O
Grecian B-Organization
, O
become O
separate O
states O
, O
governed O
by O
different O
laws O
, O
but O
always O
remained O
a O
part O
of O
the O
mother B-Organization
state I-Organization
; O
and O
all O
that O
were O
free O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
were O
also O
free O
of O
Rome B-Organization
, O
and O
had O
right O
to O
an O
equal O
suffrage O
in O
making O
all O
laws O
, O
and O
appointing O
all O
officers O
for O
the O
government B-Organization
of I-Organization
the I-Organization
whole I-Organization
common-wealth I-Organization
. O

For O
the O
truth O
of O
this O
, O
we O
have O
the O
testimony O
of O
St B-Person
. I-Person
Paul I-Person
, O
who O
though O
born O
at O
Tarsus B-Location
, O
yet O
assures O
us O
he O
was O
born O
free O
of O
Rome B-Organization
. O

And O
Grotius B-Person
gives O
us O
the O
opinion O
of O
a O
Roman B-Organization
king I-Organization
, O
concerning O
the O
freedom O
of O
colonies B-Organization
: O
King B-Person
Tullius I-Person
says O
, O
“ O
for O
our O
part O
, O
we O
look O
upon O
it O
to O
be O
neither O
truth O
nor O
justice O
, O
that O
mother O
cities O
ought O
of O
necessity O
and O
by O
the O
law O
of O
nature O
, O
to O
rule O
over O
their O
colonies B-Location
. O
” O

When O
we O
come O
down O
to O
the O
latter O
ages O
of O
the O
world O
, O
and O
consider O
the O
colonies B-Organization
planted O
in O
the O
three O
last O
centuries O
, O
in O
America B-Location
, O
from O
several O
kingdoms O
in O
Europe B-Location
, O
we O
shall O
find O
them O
, O
says O
Puffendorf B-Person
, O
very O
different O
from O
the O
ancient B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
, O
and O
gives O
us O
an O
instance O
in O
those O
of O
the O
Spaniards O
. O

Although O
it O
be O
confessed O
these O
fall O
greatly O
short O
of O
enjoying O
equal O
freedom O
with O
the O
ancient B-Organization
Greek I-Organization
and O
Roman B-Organization
ones I-Organization
; O
yet O
it O
will O
be O
said O
truly O
, O
they O
enjoy O
equal O
freedom O
with O
their O
countrymen O
in O
Spain B-Location
: O
but O
as O
they O
are O
all O
under O
the O
government O
of O
an O
absolute B-Organization
monarch I-Organization
, O
they O
have O
no O
reason O
to O
complain O
that O
one O
enjoys O
the O
liberty O
the O
other O
is O
deprived O
of O
. O

The O
French B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
will O
be O
found O
nearly O
in O
the O
same O
condition O
, O
and O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
, O
because O
their O
fellow-subjects O
in O
France B-Location
have O
also O
lost O
their O
liberty O
. O

And O
the O
question O
here O
is O
not O
whether O
all O
colonies O
, O
as O
compared O
one O
with O
another O
, O
enjoy O
equal O
liberty O
, O
but O
whether O
all O
enjoy O
as O
much O
freedom O
as O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
the O
mother B-Organization
state I-Organization
; O
and O
this O
will O
hardly O
be O
denied O
in O
the O
case O
of O
the O
Spanish B-Organization
, O
French B-Organization
, O
or O
other O
modern O
foreign O
colonies O
. O

By O
this O
it O
fully O
appears O
, O
that O
colonies O
in O
general O
, O
both O
ancient O
and O
modern O
, O
have O
always O
enjoyed O
as O
much O
freedom O
as O
the O
mother B-Organization
state I-Organization
from O
which O
they O
went O
out O
: O
And O
will O
any O
one O
suppose O
the O
British B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
in I-Organization
America I-Organization
, O
are O
an O
exception O
to O
this O
general O
rule O
? O

Colonies O
that O
came O
out O
from O
a O
kingdom O
renowned O
for O
liberty O
; O
from O
a O
constitution O
founded O
on O
compact O
; O
from O
a O
people O
, O
of O
all O
the O
sons O
of O
men O
, O
the O
most O
tenacious O
of O
freedom O
; O
who O
left O
the O
delights O
of O
their O
native O
country O
, O
parted O
from O
their O
homes O
, O
and O
all O
their O
conveniencies O
, O
searched O
out O
and O
subdued O
a O
foreign O
country O
with O
the O
most O
amazing O
travail O
and O
fortitude O
, O
to O
the O
infinite O
advantage O
and O
emolument O
of O
the O
mother O
state O
; O
that O
removed O
on O
a O
firm O
reliance O
of O
a O
solemn O
compact O
, O
and O
royal O
promise O
and O
grant O
, O
that O
they O
, O
and O
their O
successors O
forever O
, O
should O
be O
free O
; O
should O
be O
partakers O
and O
sharers O
in O
all O
the O
privileges O
and O
advantages O
of O
the O
then O
English O
, O
now O
British O
constitution O
. O

If O
it O
were O
possible O
a O
doubt O
could O
yet O
remain O
, O
in O
the O
most O
unbelieving O
mind O
, O
that O
these O
British B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
are O
not O
every O
way O
justly O
and O
fully O
intituled O
to O
equal O
liberty O
and O
freedom O
with O
their O
fellow-subjects O
in O
Europe B-Location
, O
we O
might O
shew O
, O
that O
the O
parliament B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great-Britain I-Organization
, O
have O
always O
understood O
their O
rights O
in O
the O
same O
light O

By O
an O
act O

in O
the O
thirteenth O

were O

the O

. O
” O

No O
reasonable O
man O
will O
here O
suppose O
the O
parliament B-Organization
intended O
by O
these O
acts O
to O
put O
foreigners O
, O
who O
had O
been O
in O
the O
colonies B-Location
only O
seven O
years O
, O
in O
a O
better O
condition O
than O
those O
who O
had O
been O
born O
in O
them O
, O
or O
had O
removed O
from O

thither O
, O
but O
only O
to O
put O
these O

on O
an O
equality O
with O
them O
; O
and O
to O
do O
this O
, O
they O
are O
obliged O
to O
give O
them O
all O
the O
rights O
of O

From O
what O
hath O
been O
shewn O
, O
it O
will O
appear O
beyond O
a O
doubt O
, O
that O
the O
British O
subjects O
in O
America B-Location
, O
have O
equal O
rights O
with O
those O
in O

; O
that O
they O
do O
not O
hold O
those O
rights O
as O
a O
privilege O
granted O
them O
, O
nor O
enjoy O
them O
as O
a O
grace O
and O
favor O
bestowed O
; O
but O
possess O
them O
as O
an O
inherent O
indefeasible O
right O
; O
as O
they O
, O
and O
their O
ancestors O
, O
were O
free-born O

justly O
and O
naturally O
intituled O
to O
all O
the O
rights O

advantages O
of O
the O
British O

And O
the O
British B-Organization
legislative I-Organization
and O
executive B-Organization
powers I-Organization
have O
considered O
the O
colonies B-Organization
as O
possessed O
of O
these O
rights O
, O
and O
have O
always O
heretofore O
, O
in O
the O
most O
tender O
and O
parental O
manner O
, O
treated O
them O
as O
their O
dependant O
, O
though O
free O

The O

, O
with O
chearfulness O
and O
great O
gratitude O
we O
acknowlege O
, O
hath O
at O
all O
times O
been O
given O
to O
the O
colonies B-Organization

The O
dependance O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
to O
Great-Britain B-Organization
hath O
been O
fully O
testified O
by O
a O
constant O

ready O
obedience O
to O
all O

commands O
of O
his O
present O

hath O
been O
done O
in O
Great-Britain B-Location
, O
the O
ability O
of O

considered O

It O
must O
also O
be O
confessed O
with O
thankfulness O

that O
the O
first O

for O
one O
hundred O

thirty O

fully O

— O
But O
here O
the O
scene O
seems O
to O
be O
unhappily O
changing O
: O
— O
The O
British B-Organization
ministry I-Organization
, O
whether O
induced O
by O
a O
jealousy O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
by O
false O
informations O
, O
or O
by O
some O
alteration O
in O
the O
system O
of O
political O
government O
, O
we O
have O
no O
information O
; O
whatever O
hath O
been O
the O
motive O
, O
this O
we O
are O
sure O
of O
, O
the O
parliament B-Organization
in O
their O
last O
session O
, O
passed O
an O
act O
, O
limitting O
, O
restricting O
, O
and O
burdening O
the O
trade O
of O
these O
colonies B-Organization
, O
much O
more O
than O
had O
ever O
been O
done O
before O
; O
as O
also O
for O
greatly O
enlarging O
the O
power O
and O
jurisdiction O
of O
the O
courts O
of O
admiralty O
in O
the O
colonies B-Location
; O
and O
also O
came O
to O
a O
resolution O
, O
that O
it O
might O
be O
necessary O
to O
establish O
stamp O
duties O
, O
and O
other O
internal O
taxes O
, O
to O
be O
collected O
within O
them O
. O

This O
act O
and O
this O
resolution O
have O
caused O
great O
uneasiness O
and O
consternation O
among O
the O
British O
subjects O
on O
the O
continent O
of O
America B-Location
: O
how O
much O
reason O
there O
is O
for O
it O
, O
we O
will O
endeavour O
, O
in O
the O
most O
modest O
and O
plain O
manner O
we O
can O
, O
to O
lay O
before O
our O
readers O
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
let O
it O
be O
considered O
, O
that O
although O
each O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
hath O
a O
legislature O
within O
itself O
, O
to O
take O
care O
of O
it O
’ O
s O
interests O
, O
and O
provide O
for O
it O
’ O
s O
peace O
and O
internal O
government O
, O
yet O
there O
are O
many O
things O
of O
a O
more O
general O
nature O
, O
quite O
out O
of O
the O
reach O
of O
these O
particular O
legislatures O
, O
which O
it O
is O
necessary O
should O
be O
regulated O
, O
ordered O
and O
governed O
. O

One O
of O
this O
kind O
is O
, O
the O
commerce O
of O
the O
whole O
British B-Organization
empire I-Organization
, O
taken O
collectively O
, O
and O
that O
of O
each O
kingdom O
and O
colony O
in O
it O
, O
as O
it O
makes O
a O
part O
of O
that O
whole O
: O
Indeed O
, O
every O
thing O
that O
concerns O
the O
proper O
interest O
and O
fit O
government O
of O
the O
whole O
common-wealth B-Organization
, O
of O
keeping O
the O
peace O
, O
and O
subordination O
of O
all O
the O
parts O
towards O
the O
whole O
, O
and O
one O
among O
another O
, O
must O
be O
considered O
in O
this O
light O
: O
Amongst O
these O
general O
concerns O
, O
perhaps O
, O
money O
and O
paper O
credit O
, O
those O
grand O
instruments O
of O
all O
commerce O
, O
will O
be O
found O
also O
to O
have O
a O
place O
. O

These O
, O
with O
all O
other O
matters O
of O
a O
general O
nature O
, O
it O
is O
absolutely O
necessary O
should O
have O
a O
general O
power O
to O
direct O
them O
; O
some O
supreme O
and O
over-ruling O
authority O
, O
with O
power O
to O
make O
laws O
, O
and O
form O
regulations O
for O
the O
good O
of O
all O
, O
and O
to O
compel O
their O
execution O
and O
observation O
. O

It O
being O
necessary O
some O
such O
general O
power O
should O
exist O
somewhere O
, O
every O
man O
of O
the O
least O
knowledge O
of O
the O
British O
constitution O
, O
will O
be O
naturally O
led O
to O
look O
for O
, O
and O
find O
it O
in O
the O
parliament B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great-Britain I-Organization
; O
that O
grand O
and O
august O
legislative O
body O
, O
must O
from O
the O
nature O
of O
their O
authority O
, O
and O
the O
necessity O
of O
the O
thing O
, O
be O
justly O
vested O
with O
this O
power O
. O

Hence O
, O
it O
becomes O
the O
indespensable O
duty O
of O
every O
good O
and O
loyal O
subject O
, O
chearfully O
to O
obey O
and O
patiently O
submit O
to O
all O
the O
acts O
, O
laws O
, O
orders O
and O
regulations O
that O
may O
be O
made O
and O
passed O
by O
parliament B-Organization
, O
for O
directing O
and O
governing O
all O
these O
general O
matters O
. O

Here O
it O
may O
be O
urged O
by O
many O
, O
and O
indeed O
, O
with O
great O
appearance O
of O
reason O
, O
that O
the O
equity O
, O
justice O
, O
and O
beneficence O
of O
the O
British O
constitution O
, O
will O
require O
, O
that O
the O
separate O
kingdoms B-Organization
and O
distant O
colonies B-Organization
, O
who O
are O
to O
obey O
and O
be O
governed O
by O
these O
general O
laws O
and O
regulations O
, O
ought O
to O
be O
represented O
, O
some O
way O
or O
other O
, O
in O
parliament B-Organization
; O
at O
least O
whilst O
these O
general O
matters O
are O
under O
consideration O
. O

Whether O
the O
colonies B-Organization
will O
ever O
be O
admitted O
to O
have O
representatives O
in O
parliament B-Organization
, O
— O
whether O
it O
be O
consistent O
with O
their O
distant O
and O
dependant O
state O
, O
— O
and O
whether O
if O
it O
were O
admitted O
, O
it O
would O
be O
to O
their O
advantage O
, O
— O
are O
questions O
we O
will O
pass O
by O
; O
and O
observe O
, O
that O
these O
colonies B-Organization
ought O
in O
justice O
, O
and O
for O
the O
very O
evident O
good O
of O
the O
whole O
common-wealth B-Organization
, O
to O
have O
notice O
of O
every O
new O
measure O
about O
to O
be O
pursued O
, O
and O
new O
act O
that O
is O
about O
to O
be O
passed O
, O
by O
which O
their O
rights O
, O
liberties O
, O
or O
interests O
will O
be O
affected O
: O
They O
ought O
to O
have O
such O
notice O
, O
that O
they O
may O
appear O
and O
be O
heard O
by O
their O
agents O
, O
by O
council O
, O
or O
written O
representation O
, O
or O
by O
some O
other O
equitable O
and O
effectual O
way O
. O

The O
colonies B-Location
are O
at O
so O
great O
a O
distance O
from O
England B-Location
, O
that O
the O
members O
of O
parliament B-Organization
can O
, O
generally O
, O
have O
but O
little O
knowledge O
of O
their O
business O
, O
connections O
and O
interest O
, O
but O
what O
is O
gained O
from O
people O
who O
have O
been O
there O
; O
the O
most O
of O
these O
, O
have O
so O
slight O
a O
knowledge O
themselves O
, O
that O
the O
informations O
they O
can O
give O
, O
are O
very O
little O
to O
be O
depended O
on O
, O
though O
they O
may O
pretend O
to O
determine O
with O
confidence O
, O
on O
matters O
far O
above O
their O
reach O
. O

All O
such O
kind O
of O
informations O
are O
too O
uncertain O
to O
be O
depended O
on O
, O
in O
the O
transacting O
business O
of O
so O
much O
consequence O
, O
and O
in O
which O
the O
interests O
of O
two O
millions O
of O
free O
people O
are O
so O
deeply O
concerned O
. O

There O
is O
no O
kind O
of O
inconveniency O
, O
or O
mischief O
, O
can O
arise O
from O
the O
colonies B-Location
having O
such O
notice O
, O
and O
being O
heard O
in O
the O
manner O
above-mentioned O
: O
But O
, O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
very O
great O
mischiefs O
have O
already O
happened O
to O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
and O
always O
must O
be O
expected O
, O
if O
they O
are O
not O
heard O

before O
things O
of O
such O
importance O
are O
determined O
concerning O
them O

Had O
the O

been O
fully O
heard O
, O
before O
the O
late O
act O
had O
been O
passed O
, O
no O
reasonable O
man O

manner O
the O

These O
are O
certainly O
the O
effects O
this O
act O
must O
produce O
; O
a O
duty O
of O
three O
pence O

on O
foreign O

, O
is O
well O
known O
to O
every O
man O
in O
the O

with O
it O
, O
to O
be O
much O
higher O
than O
that O
article O
can O
possibly O

and O
therefore O
must O
operate O
as O
an O
absolute O

This O

put O

Putting O
an O
end O
to O
the O
importation O
of O
foreign O
melasses O
, O
at O
the O

time O
puts O
an O

the O
foreign O

, O
the O

That O
this O

the O

is O
not O
fancy O

this O

nor O
any O

is O
not O
exaggeration O

a O
sober O

View O
this O
duty O
of O
three O

, O
on O
foreign O

, O
not O
in O
the O
light O
of O

supposing O
the O

to O
continue O
, O
and O
the O
duty O
to O
be O
paid O
. O

Heretofore O
there O

only O
, O
about O
one O
million O
one O

fifty O

the O
duty O
on O
this O
quantity O
is O
fourteen O
thousand O
three O
hundred O

seventy-five O
pounds O
, O
sterling O
, O
to O
be O
paid O
yearly O
by O

little O
colony B-Organization

a O
larger O
sum O
than O
was O
ever O

This O

yet O
the O

is O
to O

repeated O
every O

— O
Can O
this O
possibly O
be O
done O
? O

Can O
a O
new O
colony O
, O
compelled O
by O
necessity O
to O
purchase O
all O
it O
’ O

cloathing O

after O

pay O
twenty-four O

a O
year O

for O
the O
duties O
of O
a O

only O
? O

There O
is O
surely O
no O
man O
in O
his O
right O
mind O
believes O
this O
possible O
. O

The O
charging O
foreign O
melasses O
with O
this O
high O
duty O
, O
will O
not O
affect O
all O
the O
colonies B-Organization
equally O
, O
nor O
any O
other O
near O
so O
much O
as O
this O
of O
Rbode-Island B-Organization
, O
whose O
trade O
depended O
much O
more O
on O
foreign O
melasses O
, O
and O
on O
distilleries O
, O
than O
that O
of O
any O
others O
; O
this O
must O
shew O
that O
raising O
money O
for O
the O
general O
service O
of O
the O
crown B-Organization
, O
or O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
by O
such O
a O
duty O
, O
will O
be O
extremely O
unequal O
, O
and O
therefore O
unjust O
. O

And O
now O
taking O
either O
alternative O
; O
by O
supposing O
on O
one O
hand O
, O
the O
foreign O
melasses O
trade O
is O
stopped O
, O
and O
with O
it O
the O
opportunity O
or O
ability O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
to O
get O
money O
, O
or O
on O
the O
other O
, O
that O
this O
trade O
is O
continued O
, O
and O
that O
the O
colonies B-Organization
get O
money O
by O
it O
, O
but O
all O
their O
money O
is O
taken O
from O
them O
by O
paying O
the O
duty O
; O
can O
Britain B-Organization
be O
gainer O
by O
either O
? O

Is O
it O
not O
the O
chiefest O
interest O
of O
Britain B-Organization
, O
to O
dispose O
of O
and O
to O
be O
paid O
for O
her O

And O
doth O
she O
not O
find O
the O
greatest O
and O
best O
market O
for O
them O
in O
her O
own O
colonies B-Location
? O

Will O
she O
find O
an O
advantage O
in O
disabling O
the O
colonies B-Organization
to O
continue O
their O
trade O
with O
her O
? O

Or O
can O
she O
possibly O
grow O
rich O
by O
their O
being O
made O
poor O
? O

Ministers O
have O
great O
influence O
, O
and O
parliaments O
have O
great O
power O
; O
— O
can O
either O
of O
them O
change O
the O
nature O
of O
things O
, O
stop O
all O
our O
means O
of O
getting O
money O
, O
and O
yet O
expect O
us O
to O
purchase O
and O
pay O
for O
British O
manufactures O
? O

The O
genius O
of O
the O
people O
in O
these O

is O
as O
little O
turned O
to O
manufacturing O
goods O

as O
is O
possible O
to O
suppose O
in O
any O

yet O
necessity O

compel O
them O
, O
either O
to O
go O
naked O

or O
to O
make O

This O
must O
greatly O
affect O
the O

what O

Courts B-Organization

these O

always O

the O

before O
such O

for O
trial O

in O
the O
manner O
it O
ought O
to O

done O
, O
and O
in O
a O
way O
only O
moderately O

to O

if O

without O
reason O

his O
temerity O

But O
now O
this O
course O
is O
quite O
altered O
, O
and O
a O
custom-house O
officer O
may O
make O
a O
seizure O

carry O
the O

at O
fifteen O
hundred O

and O
thither O
the O

follow O
him O

and O
when O

he O

find O

him O
in O
a O

If O

( O
which O
it O
is O
very O
well O

there O
was O
only O

Such O
unbounded O

Surely O
if O
the O

had O
been O
fully O
heard O
, O
before O
this O
had O
been O
done O
, O
the O
liberties O
and O
properties O
of O
the O
Americans O
would O
not O
have O
been O
so O

The O
resolution O
of O
the O
house B-Organization
of I-Organization

, O
come O
into O
during O
the O
same O
session O
of O

asserting O
their O
rights O

internal O
taxes O
, O
to O
be O
collected O
in O
the O

consent O

much O
more O
, O
and O
for O
much O
more O
reason O
, O
alarmed O
the O
British O
subjects O
in O
America B-Location
, O
than O
any O
thing O
that O
had O
ever O
been O
done O
before O
. O

These O
resolutions O
, O
carried O
into O
execution O
, O
the O
colonies B-Organization
cannot O
help O
but O
consider O
as O
a O
manifest O
violation O
of O
their O
just O
and O
long O
enjoyed O
rights O
. O

For O
it O
must O
be O
confessed O
by O
all O
men O
, O
that O
they O
who O
are O
taxed O
at O
pleasure O
by O
others O
, O
cannot O
possibly O
have O
any O
property O
, O
can O
have O
nothing O
to O
be O
called O
their O
own O
; O
they O
who O
have O
no O
property O
, O
can O
have O
no O
freedom O
, O
but O
are O
indeed O
reduced O
to O
the O
most O
abject O
slavery O
; O
are O
in O
a O
condition O
far O
worse O
than O
countries O
conquered O
and O
made O
tributary O
; O
for O
these O
have O
only O
a O
fixed O
sum O
to O
pay O
, O
which O
they O
are O
left O
to O
raise O
among O
themselves O
, O
in O
the O
way O
that O
they O
may O
think O
most O
equal O
and O
easy O
; O
and O
having O
paid O
the O
stipulated O
sum O
, O
the O
debt O
is O
discharged O
, O
and O
what O
is O
left O
is O
their O
own O
. O

This O
is O
much O
more O
tolerable O
than O
to O
be O
taxed O
at O
the O
meer O
will O
of O
others O
, O
without O
any O
bounds O
, O
without O
any O
stipulation O
and O
agreement O
, O
contrary O
to O
their O
consent O
, O
and O
against O
their O
will O
. O

If O
we O
are O
told O
that O
those O
who O
lay O
these O
taxes O
upon O
the O
colonies B-Location
, O
are O
men O
of O
the O
highest O
character O
for O
their O
wisdom O
, O
justice O
, O
and O
integrity O
, O
and O
therefore O
cannot O
be O
supposed O
to O
deal O
hardly O
, O
unjustly O
, O
or O
unequally O
by O
any O
; O
admitting O
, O
and O
really O
believing O
that O
all O
this O
is O
true O
, O
it O
will O
make O
no O
alteration O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
case O
; O
for O
one O
who O
is O
bound O
to O
obey O
the O
will O
of O
another O
, O
is O
as O
really O
a O
slave O
, O
though O
he O
may O
have O
a O
good O
master O
, O
as O
if O
he O
had O
a O
bad O
one O
; O
and O
this O
is O
stronger O
in O
politic O
bodies O
than O
in O
natural O
ones O
, O
as O
the O
former O
have O
perpetual O
succession O
, O
and O
remain O
the O
same O
; O
and O
although O
they O
may O
have O
a O
very O
good O
master O
at O
one O
time O
, O
they O
may O
have O
a O
very O
bad O
one O
at O
another O
. O

And O
indeed O
, O
if O
the O
people O
in O
America B-Location
, O
are O
to O
be O
taxed O
by O
the O
representatives B-Organization
of I-Organization
the I-Organization
people I-Organization
in O
Britain B-Location
, O
their O
malady O
is O
an O
increasing O
evil O
, O
that O
must O
always O
grow O
greater O
by O
time O
. O

Whatever O
burdens O
are O
laid O
upon O
the O
Americans O
, O
will O
be O
so O
much O
taken O
off O
the O
Britons O
; O
and O
the O
doing O
this O
will O
soon O
be O
extremely O
popular O
, O
and O
those O
who O
put O
up O
to O
be O
members O
of O
the O
house B-Organization
of I-Organization
commons I-Organization
, O
must O
obtain O
the O
votes O
of O
the O
people O
by O
promising O
to O
take O
more O
and O
more O
of O
the O
taxes O
off O
them O
, O
by O
putting O
it O
on O
the O
Americans O
. O

This O
must O
most O
assuredly O
be O
the O
case O
, O
and O
it O
will O
not O
be O
in O
the O
power O
even O
of O
the O
parliament B-Organization
to O
prevent O
it O
; O
the O

they O

such O

only O
such O

act O
agreeable O
to O
this O

these O

by O

the O

He O
then O
invited O
the O

while O
they O
stood O
gazing O
on O
the O
mighty O
heaps O

gold O

Constantius B-Person
told O
them O

that O
the O

they O
beheld O
with O
astonishment O

the O

We O
are O
not O
insensible O
, O
that O
when O
liberty O
is O
in O
danger O
, O
the O
liberty O
of O
complaining O
is O
dangerous O
; O
yet O
, O
a O
man O
on O
a O
wreck O
was O
never O
denied O
the O
liberty O
of O
roaring O
as O
loud O
as O
he O
could O
; O

Dean B-Person

And O
we O
believe O
no O
good O
reason O
can O
be O
given O
, O
why O
the O

should O
not O
modestly O

soberly O
enquire O
, O
what O
right O
the O

have O
to O

them O

We O
know O
such O
enquiries O
, O
by O
a O
late O
letter-writer O
, O
have O
been O
branded O
with O
the O
little O
epithet O
of O
mushroom O
policy O

and O
he O
insinuates O
, O
that O
for O
the O
colonies B-Organization
to O
pretend O
to O
claim O
any O
privileges O
, O
will O
draw O
down O
the O
resentment O
of O
the O
parliament B-Organization

them O

— O
Is O
the O
defence O
of O
liberty O
become O
so O
contemptible O
, O
and O
pleading O
for O
just O
rights O
so O
dangerous O
? O

Can O
the O
guardians O
of O

be O
thus O
ludicrous O
? O

Can O
the O
patrons O
of O

be O
so O
jealous O

so O
severe O

— O
If O
the O
British B-Organization

are O
rightfully O
possessed O
of O
a O
power O
to O

, O
this O
power O
must O
be O
vested O

as O
they O
are O
one O

they O

beyond O

all O
the O

give O
; O
yet O

great O

this O

surely O
it O
cannot O
exceed O
that O

can O
it O

be O

that O
the O

a O

“ O
We O

for O
they O

all O

may O
be O
fully O

even O

it O
will O

have O

themselves O

If O

it O

justly O

that O
the O

we O

What O
occasion O

what O

Are O

as O
loyal O
and O
dutiful O
subjects O
as O
any O
age O
or O
nation O
ever O
produced O

— O
and O
are O
they O
not O

remote O

The O

confessed O

power O

regulate O
the O

the O
whole O

hath O
it O
not O
full O
power O

by O

draw O
all O
the O

all O
the O

of O
the O

the O

What O
motive O
, O
after O
all O
this O
, O
can O
remain O
, O
to O
induce O
the O
parliament B-Organization
to O
abridge O
the O
privileges O

and O
lessen O
the O
rights O
of O
the O
most O
loyal O

subjects O
justly O
intituled O

long O

advantage O

dutiful O
subserviency O
to O
the O
orders O
and O

of O
Great-Britain B-Organization

Why O
should O
the O
gentle O
current O
of O
tranquillity O
, O
that O
has O
so O
long O
run O
with O
peace O
through O
all O
the O
British B-Location
states I-Location
, O
and O
flowed O
with O

all O
her O
countries B-Location
, O
be O
at O

obstructed O
, O
be O
turned O
out O
of O
its O
true O
course O
, O
into O
unusual O
and O
winding O
channels O
, O
by O
which O
many O
of O
those O
states O
must O
be O
ruined O
; O
but O
none O
of O
them O
can O
possibly O
be O
made O
more O
rich O
or O
more O
happy O
? O

Before O
we O
conclude O
, O
it O
may O
be O
necessary O
to O
take O
notice O
of O
the O
vast O
difference O
there O
is O
between O
the O
raising O
money O
in O
a O
country O
by O
duties O
, O
taxes O
, O
or O
otherwise O
, O
and O
employing O
and O
laying O
out O
the O
money O
again O
in O
the O
same O
country O
; O
and O
raising O
the O
like O
sums O
of O
money O
, O
by O
the O
like O
means O
, O
and O
sending O
it O
away O
quite O
out O
of O
the O
country O
where O
it O
is O
raised O
. O

Where O
the O
former O
of O
these O
is O
the O
case O
, O
although O
the O
sums O
raised O
may O
be O
very O
great O
, O
yet O
that O
country O
may O
support O
itself O
under O
them O
; O
for O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
money O
is O
collected O
together O
, O
it O
is O
again O
scattered O
abroad O
, O
to O
be O
used O
in O
commerce O
and O
every O
kind O
of O
business O
; O
and O
money O
is O
not O
made O
scarcer O
by O
this O
means O
, O
but O
rather O
the O
contrary O
, O
as O
this O
continual O
circulation O
must O
have O
a O
tendency O
to O
prevent O
, O
in O
some O
degree O
, O
it O
’ O
s O
being O
hoarded O
. O

But O
where O
the O
latter O
method O
is O
pursued O
, O
the O
effect O
will O
be O
extremely O
different O
; O
for O
here O
, O
as O
fast O
as O
the O
money O
can O
be O
collected O
, O
’ O
tis O
immediately O
sent O
out O
of O
the O
country O
, O
never O
to O
return O
but O
by O
a O
tedious O
round O
of O
commerce O
, O
which O
at O
best O
must O
take O
up O
much O
time O
: O
Here O
all O
trade O
, O
and O
every O
kind O
of O
business O
depending O
on O
it O
, O
will O
grow O
dull O
, O
and O
must O
languish O
more O
and O
more O
, O
until O
it O
comes O
to O
a O
final O
stop O
at O
last O
. O

If O
the O
money O
raised O
in O
Great-Britain B-Location
in O
the O
three O
last O
years O
of O
the O
late O
war O
, O
and O
which O
exceeded O
forty O
millions O
sterling O
, O
had O
been O
sent O
out O
of O
the O
kingdom B-Organization
, O
would O
not O
this O
have O
nearly O
ruined O
the O
trade O
of O
the O
nation B-Organization
in O
three O
years O
only O
? O

Think O
then O
, O
what O
must O
be O
the O
condition O
of O
these O
miserable O
colonies B-Organization
, O
when O
all O
the O
money O
proposed O
to O
be O
raised O
in O
them O
, O
by O
high O
duties O
on O
the O
importation O
of O
divers O
kinds O
of O
goods O
, O
by O
the O
post-office O
, O
by O
stamp O
duties O
, O
and O
other O
taxes O
, O
is O
sent O
quite O
away O
, O
as O
fast O
as O
it O
can O
be O
collected O
; O
and O
this O
to O
be O
repeated O
continually O
, O
and O
last O
forever O
! O

Is O
it O
possible O
for O
colonies O
under O
these O
circumstances O
to O
support O
themselves O
, O
to O
have O
any O
money O
, O
any O
trade O
, O
or O
other O
business O
, O
carried O
on O
in O
them O
? O

Certainly O
it O
is O
not O
; O
nor O
is O
there O
at O
present O
, O
or O
ever O
was O
, O
any O
country O
under O
heaven O
, O
that O
did O
, O
or O
possibly O
could O
support O
itself O
under O
such O
burdens O
. O

We O
finally O
beg O
leave O
to O
assert O
, O
that O
the O
first O
planters O
of O
these O
colonies O
were O
pious O
christians O
; O
were O
faithful O
subjects O
; O
who O
, O
with O
a O
fortitude O
and O
perseverance O
little O
known O
, O
and O
less O
considered O
, O
settled O
these O
wild O
countries O
, O
by O
GOD O
’ O
s O
goodness O
, O
and O
their O
own O
amazing O
labours O
; O
thereby O
added O
a O
most O
valuable O
dependance O
to O
the O
crown B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great-Britain I-Organization
; O
were O
ever O
dutifully O
subservient O
to O
her O
interests O
; O
so O
taught O
their O
children O
, O
that O
not O
one O
has O
been O
disaffected O
to O
this O
day O
; O
but O
all O
have O
honestly O
obeyed O
every O
royal O
command O
, O
and O
chearfully O
submitted O
to O
every O
constitutional O
law O
; O
have O
as O
little O
inclination O
as O
they O
have O
ability O
to O
throw O
off O
their O
dependancy O
; O
have O
carefully O
avoided O
every O
offensive O
measure O
, O
and O
every O
interdicted O
manufacture O
; O
have O
risqued O
their O
lives O
as O
they O
have O
been O
ordered O
, O
and O
furnished O
their O
money O
when O
it O
has O
been O
called O
for O
; O
have O
never O
been O
troublesome O
or O
expensive O
to O
the O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
; O
have O
kept O
due O
order O
, O
and O
supported O
a O
regular O
government O
; O
have O
maintained O
peace O
, O
and O
practised O
christianity O
; O
and O
in O
all O
conditions O
, O
and O
in O
every O
relation O
, O
have O
demeaned O
themselves O
as O
loyal O
, O
as O
dutiful O
, O
and O
as O
faithful O
subjects O
ought O
; O
and O
that O
no O
kingdom O
or O
state O
hath O
, O
or O
ever O
had O
, O
colonies O
more O
quiet O
, O
more O
obedient O

or O
more O
profitable O

than O
these O
have O
ever O

May O
the O
