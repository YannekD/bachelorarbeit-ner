The O
Stamp O
Act O
, O
which O
was O
approved O
in O
the O
House B-Organization
of I-Organization
Commons I-Organization
on O
February O
27 O
, O
1765 O
, O
and O
given O
royal O
assent O
on O
March O

, O
imposed O
a O
tax O
on O
legal O
documents O
, O

, O

, O
almanacs O
, O
newspapers O
, O
college O
diplomas O
, O
playing O
cards O
, O
indeed O
, O
on O
nearly O
every O
form O
of O
paper O
used O
in O
the O
colonies B-Location
. O

Although O
some O
of O
the O
colonial B-Organization
assemblies I-Organization
had O
issued O
stamp O
taxes O
, O
never O
before O
had O
Parliament B-Organization
attempted O
to O
impose O
this O
kind O
of O
internal O
tax O
on O
the O
colonists O
. O

Once O
the O
ministry B-Organization
sensed O
a O
stirring O
of O
colonial O
opposition O
to O
the O
imperial O
reforms O
, O
a O
group O
of O
able O
English O
writers O
connected O
with O
the O
government B-Organization
set O
out O
to O
explain O
and O
justify O
the O
new O
regulations O
and O
taxes O
in O
a O
series O
of O
pamphlets O
. O

The O
most O
important O
and O
persuasive O
of O
these O
defenses O
of O
British O
policy O
was O
the O
following O
pamphlet O
, O
which O
was O
attributed O
to O
George B-Person
Grenville I-Person
, O
the O
prime B-Organization
minister I-Organization
from O
1763 O
to O
1765 O
, O
but O
which O
was O
actually O
written O
by O
Thomas B-Person
Whately I-Person
, O
undersecretary B-Organization
to I-Organization
Grenville I-Organization
at O
the O
treasury O
and O
the O
principal O
drafter O
of O
the O
Stamp O
Act O
. O

Before O
offering O
a O
justification O
of O
his O
measure O
, O
though O
, O
Whately B-Person
devoted O
much O
of O
his O
lengthy O
pamphlet O
to O
his O
vision O
of O
a O
well-regulated O
and O
prosperous O
empire B-Organization
. O

Throughout O
he O
demonstrated O
an O
extraordinarily O
detailed O
knowledge O
of O
all O
aspects O
of O
the O
various O
colonies B-Organization
, O
including O
the O
value O
of O
numerous O
colonial O
commodities—from O
beaver O
skins O
to O
whale O
fins O
, O
rice O
to O
hemp O
. O

The O
administration B-Organization
of O
this O
“ O
opulent O
, O
commercial O
, O
thriving O
” O
empire O
required O
money O
, O
and O
against O
this O
backdrop O
the O
need O
for O
American O
revenue O
emerged O
as O
the O
focus O
of O
his O
pamphlet O
. O

Whately B-Person
conceded O
that O
no O
British O
subject O
could O
be O
taxed O
without O
the O
consent O
of O
his O
representatives O
; O
but O
since O
he O
believed O
that O
the O
colonists O
were O
intimately O
connected O
to O
the O
people O
of O
the O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
, O
being O
both O
parts O
of O
“ O
one O
Nation O
, O
” O
he O
readily O
justified O
Parliament B-Organization
’ O
s O
extraction O
of O
the O
needed O
revenue O
by O
what O
the O
British O
called O
“ O
virtual O
representation O
. O
” O

Although O
the O
colonists O
, O
like O
many O
Englishmen O
in O
the O
mother B-Location
country I-Location
, O
did O
not O
actually O
vote O
for O
members O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
, O
they O
were O
nonetheless O
virtually O
represented O
there O
, O
and O
consequently O
bound O
by O
its O
laws O
. O

The O
people O
were O
represented O
not O
by O
the O
electoral O
process O
, O
that O
is O
, O
by O
voting O
, O
which O
was O
incidental O
to O
representation O
, O
but O
instead O
by O
the O
mutual O
interests O
that O
members O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
were O
presumed O
to O
share O
with O
all O
Britons O
for O
whom O
they O
spoke—including O
those O
, O
like O
the O
colonists O
, O
who O
did O
not O
actually O
vote O
for O
them O
. O

How O
the O
representatives O
got O
to O
the O
House B-Organization
of I-Organization
Commons I-Organization
was O
irrelevant O
to O
their O
ability O
to O
represent O
the O
interests O
of O
the O
nation B-Organization
. O

Absurd O
as O
this O
concept O
of O
virtual O
representation O
seemed O
to O
many O
Americans O
, O
it O
justified O
the O
binding O
of O
the O
whole O
people O
, O
in O
Whately B-Person
’ O
s O
words O
, O
“ O
by O
the O
Consent O
of O
the O
Majority O
of O
that O
House B-Organization
, O
whether O
their O
own O
particular O
Representatives O
consented O
to O
or O
opposed O
the O
Measures O
there O
taken O
, O
or O
whether O
they O
had O
or O
had O
not O
particular O
Representatives O
there O
. O
” O

It O
was O
probably O
the O
best O
justification O
of O
majority O
rule O
ever O
made O
. O

The O
Regulations O
Lately O
made O
with O
Respect O
to O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
Considered O
. O

T O
HE O
immediate O
Defence O
of O
our O
Colonies B-Location
from O
imminent O
Danger O
, O
was O
the O
sole O
occasion O
of O
the O
last O
War O
: O
Their O
permanent O
Security O
has O
been O
effectually O
obtained O
by O
the O
Peace O
: O
And O
even O
their O
Aggrandizement O
and O
Improvement O
have O
been O
provided O
for O
by O
the O
Negotiators O
of O
that O
Treaty O
, O
beyond O
the O
idea O
of O
any O
former O
Administration O
: O
There O
have O
been O
Ministers O
ignorant O
of O
the O
Importance O
of O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
; O
others O
, O
have O
impotently O
neglected O
their O
Concerns O
; O
and O
others O
again O
have O
been O
diverted O
by O
meaner O
Pursuits O
from O
attending O
to O
them O
: O
But O
happily O
for O
this O
Country B-Organization
, O
the O
Real O
and O
Substantial O
, O
and O
those O
are O
the O
Commercial O
Interests O
of O
Great B-Organization
Britain I-Organization
, O
are O
now O
preferred O
to O
every O
other O
Consideration O
: O
And O
the O
Trade O
from O
whence O
its O
greatest O
Wealth O
is O
derived O
, O
and O
upon O
which O
its O
Maritime O
Power O
is O
principally O
founded O
, O
depends O
upon O
a O
wise O
and O
proper O
use O
of O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
: O
From O
them O
we O
are O
to O
expect O
the O
Multiplication O
of O
Subjects O
; O
the O
Consumption O
of O
our O
Manufactures O
; O
the O
Supply O
of O
those O
Commodities O

we O

to O

and O
to O
cement O
and O
perfect O
the O
necessary O
Connection O
between O
them O

should O
therefore O
be O
the O
principal O
Objects O
of O
a O
British O
Minister O
’ O

many O
Steps O
have O
been O
lately O
taken O
, O
which O
by O
their O
immediate O
Operation O
, O
or O
distant O
Consequences O
, O
may O
materially O
affect O
these O
important O
Concerns O
. O

Every O
Man O
who O
is O
sincerely O
interested O
in O
whatever O
is O
interesting O
to O
his O
Country O
, O
will O
anxiously O
consider O
the O
Propriety O
of O
these O
Measures O
; O
will O
enquire O
into O
the O
Information O
, O
and O
Canvass O
the O
Principles O
upon O
which O
they O
have O
been O
adopted O
; O
and O
will O
be O
ready O
to O
applaud O
what O
has O
been O
well O
done O
; O
to O
condemn O
what O
has O
been O
done O
amiss O
; O
and O
to O
suggest O
any O
Emendations O

Improvements O

or O
Additions O
, O
which O
may O
lie O
within O
his O
Knowledge O

and O
occur O
to O
his O
Reflection O
. O

The O
following O
Sheets O
are O
written O
with O
a O
View O
to O
facilitate O
such O
an O
Examination O
: O
They O
pretend O
to O
no O
more O
than O
to O
collect O
the O
several O
Regulations O
that O
have O
been O
lately O
made O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
: O
To O
weigh O
the O
Reasons O
upon O
which O
each O
of O
them O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
founded O
; O
and O
to O
see O
how O
far O
these O
are O
supported O
by O
Facts O
, O
and O
by O
Maxims O
of O
Trade O
and O
of O
Policy O
. O

These O
Regulations O
are O
many O
; O
and O
have O
been O
made O
in O
the O
different O
Departments O
of O
our O
Legislative O
or O
Executive O
Government B-Organization
: O
They O
are O
therefore O
scattered O
thro O
’ O
Proclamations O
, O
Statutes O
, O
and O
Orders O
: O
But O
they O
are O
all O
of O
equal O
Publick O
Notoriety O
; O
which O
every O
Man O
may O
know O
; O
which O
every O
Man O
ought O
to O
know O
; O
and O
which O
when O
brought O
into O
one O
View O
and O
considered O
together O
, O
will O
appear O
to O
be O
either O
crude O
, O
incoherent O
, O
weak O
and O
pernicious O
Acts O
of O
Power O
, O
or O
a O
well O
digested O
consistent O
, O
wise O
and O
salutary O
Plan O
of O
Colonization O
and O
Government O
. O

The O
new O
Acquisitions O
will O
naturally O
first O
attract O
our O
Attention O
: O
They O
are O
vast O
in O
extent O
, O
and O
richly O
productive O
of O
the O
valuable O
Commodities O
which O
belong O
to O
their O
several O
Climates O
; O
but O
besides O
these O
, O
we O
derive O
further O
Advantages O
from O
them O
on O
Account O
of O
their O
Situations O
: O
The O
Possession O
of O
those O
in O
North B-Location
America I-Location
ensures O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
other O
Colonies O
there O
; O
insomuch O
, O
that O
our O
only O
dangerous O
Neighbours O
, O
the O
French O
, O
do O
not O
think O
the O
Pittance O
that O
was O
left O
them O
on O
the O
Continent B-Location
, O
worth O
Retaining O
, O
but O
by O
the O
Cession O
they O
are O
said O
to O
have O
made O
of O
Louisiana B-Location
to O
the O
Spaniards O
, O
have O
avowedly O
given O
up O
for O
ever O
those O
great O
Objects O
, O
for O
which O
alone O
they O
began O
the O
War O
. O

The O
ceded B-Location
Islands I-Location
are O
of O
almost O
equal O
Consequence O
, O
for O
Protecting O
our O
own O
, O
and O
for O
Annoying O
the O
Settlements O
of O
the O
French O
and O
Spaniards O
, O
if O
they O
should O
be O
again O
our O
Enemies O
. O

But O
the O
greater O
the O
Importance O
of O
these O
Accessions O
to O
the O
British B-Location
Dominion I-Location
, O
so O
much O
the O
more O
Care O
and O
Circumspection O
is O
requisite O
in O
the O
Dispositions O
to O
be O
made O
concerning O
them O
: O
And O
such O
is O
the O
Difference O
of O
their O
Situations O
and O
Circumstances O
, O
that O
the O
same O
Regulations O
may O
be O
necessary O
to O
the O
one O
, O
and O
fatal O
to O
the O
other O
. O

The O
Benefit O
which O
accrues O
to O
the O
Mother-Country B-Organization
from O
a O
Colony O
on O
the O
Continent B-Location
, O
principally O
depends O
on O
the O
Number O
of O
its O
Inhabitants O
; O
that O
of O
a O
Plantation O
in O
the O
Islands B-Location
arises O
from O
the O
Richness O
of O
its O
Commodities O
: O
We O
rely O
on O
the O
former O
chiefly O
for O
the O
Consumption O
of O
our O
Manufactures O
: O
We O
expect O
more O
from O
the O
Produce O
of O
the O
latter O
, O
for O
our O
own O
Consumption O
and O
for O
Exportation O
: O
This O
Distinction O
is O
so O
strictly O
true O
, O
that O
tho O
’ O
the O
Supply O
required O
by O
the O
Inhabitants O
of O
the O
West-Indies B-Location
is O
in O
value O
much O
beyond O
that O
which O
is O
necessary O
to O
the O
Americans O
in O
Proportion O
to O
their O
Numbers O
, O
yet O
, O
that O
Wealth O
, O
that O
Luxury O
, O
and O
those O
Circumstances O
of O
Climate O
, O
which O
incline O
them O
to O
Extravagance O
, O
at O
the O
same O
Time O
induce O
them O
to O
prefer O
the O
finer O
Productions O
of O
other O
Countries O
, O
to O
the O
coarse O
Commodities O
of O
our O
own O
; O
for O
the O
Manufactures O
of O
Great B-Location
Britain I-Location
are O
good O
, O
rich O
, O
and O
solid O
, O
but O
not O
delicate O
; O
strong O
without O
Grace O
; O
and O
rather O
substantial O
than O
elegant O
: O
To O
the O
plain O
, O
the O
industrious O
and O
frugal O
Republican O
of O
America B-Location
, O
who O
is O
content O
with O
the O
Necessaries O
of O
Life O
, O
these O
are O
welcome O
, O
because O
they O
are O
useful O
: O
but O
they O
are O
not O
equally O
acceptable O
to O
the O
West-Indians O
, O
who O
think O
themselves O
intitled O
to O
Superfluities O
, O
and O
whose O
aristocratical O
Opulence O
enables O
them O
to O
demand O
the O
Products O
of O
the O
East-Indies B-Location
, O
and O
other O
Countries O
, O
more O
similar O
in O
Climate O
, O
in O
Taste O
, O
and O
in O
Manners O
, O
to O
their O
own O
. O

We O
are O
therefore O
for O
the O
most O
part O
only O
Merchants O
to O
the O
one O
, O
and O
sell O
to O
them O
what O
we O
ourselves O
purchase O
; O
but O
we O
are O
both O
Merchants O
and O
Manufacturers O
to O
the O
other O
. O

The O
Returns O
too O
from O
each O
of O
these O
Countries O
, O
are O
as O
different O
as O
their O
Demands O
: O
The O
Products O
of O
the O
Continent B-Location
are O
the O
Earnings O
of O
Industry O
; O
those O
of O
the O
Islands B-Location
are O
the O
Improvements O
of O
Wealth O
: O
To O
an O
American O
therefore O
a O
numerous O
Family O
is O
Substance O
; O
but O
a O
West O
Indian O
must O
depend O
entirely O
upon O
his O
Capital O
: O
He O
cannot O
labour O
himself O
; O
he O
can O
acquire O
nothing O
but O
by O
Purchase O
and O
Expence O
. O

From O
this O
Difference O
of O
Circumstances O
it O
is O
evident O
, O
that O
the O
Object O
of O
Government O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
Acquisitions O
in O
North B-Location
America I-Location
, O
should O
be O
to O
tempt O

to O
encourage O
Population O
; O
and O
with O
respect O
to O
the O

to O
enforce O
the O
speedy O
Culture O

Improvement O
of O

such O
valuable O

, O
but O
still O
requiring O
a O
considerable O
Expence O
to O
raise O

Lands O
therefore O
should O
be O

and O
many O
other O
Circumstances O
of O
Recommendation O
, O
there O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
new B-Location
Colonies I-Location
, O
when O
put O
upon O
the O
same O
Footing O
with O
the O
other O
, O
will O
be O
peopled O
very O
soon O
. O

Many O
foreign O
Protestants O
will O
go O
thither O
. O

I O
fear O
they O
will O
be O
too O
much O
resorted O
to O
from O
these O
Kingdoms B-Location
, O
and O
from O
Ireland B-Location
, O
unless O
Employment O
can O
be O
found O
at O
home O
for O
those O
who O
must O
else O
seek O
it O
at O
a O
distance O
; O
but O
the O
greatest O
Supply O
will O
be O
from O
America B-Location
itself O
; O
for O
such O
has O
been O
the O
Population O
of O
that O
Country B-Location
, O
that O
many O
Parts O
of O
it O
can O
afford O
to O
furnish O
Inhabitants O
to O
others O
. O

The O
enterprizing O
Spirit O
and O
Passion O
for O
Discovery O
, O
which O
led O
its O
first O
Settlers O
thither O
, O
is O
not O
extinct O
in O
their O
Posterity O
, O
who O
are O
still O
inclined O
to O
rove O
in O
quest O
of O
new O
Habitations O
: O
They O
are O
all O
bred O
to O
the O
Idea O
of O
clearing O
fresh O
Lands O
, O
and O
of O
acquiring O
to O
themselves O
such O
Estates O
as O
their O
Fathers O
acquired O
, O
by O
those O
Means O
which O
they O
have O
seen O
so O
successful O
in O
their O
own O
Families O
. O

In O
the O
Provinces B-Location
which O
are O
not O
yet O
well O
settled O
, O
this O
Principle O
operates O
within O
the O
Provinces B-Location
themselves O
; O
but O
there O
are O
some O
, O
in O
which O
the O
greater O
Part O
of O
the O
Lands O
near O
the O
Sea O
Coasts O
and O
Banks O
of O
Rivers O
, O
are O
already O
occupied O
; O
and O
there O
the O
same O
Principle O
impels O
the O
younger O
Inhabitants O
to O
Migration O
. O

If O
the O
Colony O
should O
at O
first O
regret O
their O
Departure O
, O
the O
Loss O
will O
quickly O
be O
repaired O
by O
those O
who O
are O
left O
, O
and O
who O
in O
a O
few O
Years O
will O
be O
able O
to O
fill O
up O
the O
Intervals O
still O
remaining O
between O
the O
several O
Settlements O
; O
and O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
Mother O
Country O
, O
it O
is O
certainly O
very O
desirable O
that O
her O
People O
should O
be O
spread O
along O
every O
Coast O
and O
every O
River O
within O
her O
Dominions O
; O
for O
the O
Means O
of O
Subsistance O
will O
be O
easier O
there O
, O
than O
in O
the O
interior O
Parts O
of O
the O
old O
Colonies O
: O
The O
Settlers O
will O
consequently O
multiply O
faster O
, O
and O
their O
Consumption O
of O
our O
Manufactures O
will O
in O
the O
End O
be O
greater O
; O
they O
must O
apply O
to O
Agriculture O
alone O
; O
their O
Plantations O
will O
be O
open O
to O
immediate O
Access O
, O
as O
well O
for O
receiving O
our O
Supply O
, O
as O
for O
returning O
to O
us O
their O
Produce O
; O
and O
neither O
the O
old O
nor O
the O
new O
Colony O
, O
so O
long O
as O
they O
have O
Lands O
given O
them O
to O
cultivate O
, O
will O
have O

at O
leisure O
to O
turn O
to O
Manufactures O
: O
the O
Connection O
of O
both O
with O
the O
Mother-Country O
is O
thereby O
strengthened O
, O
and O
thus O
our O
new O
Acquisitions O
instead O
of O
making O
the O
British B-Organization
Empire I-Organization
too O
great O
and O
unwieldly O
; O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
enhance O
the O

secure O
the O

alone O
produce O
the O
Effect O
I O
have O
described O
, O
is O
not O
Matter O
of O
Speculation O

is O
founded O
upon O
constant O

brought O
down O
to O
the O

by O
very O
recent O
Instances O

That O
Part O

was O
held O
by O
the O
neutral O
French O

has O
since O
their O
Removal O
been O
resorted O
to O
with O
an O
Eagerness O
hardly O
conceivable O
: O
I O
am O
greatly O
within O
Compass O
when O
I O
say O
that O
it O
contains O
already O
above O
Ten O
Thousand O
Inhabitants O
, O
all O
settled O
within O
the O
Compass O
of O
Six O
or O
Seven O
Years O
; O
by O
whose O
Industry O
that O
Province O

which O
so O
lately O
was O
considered O
as O
no O
more O
than O
a O
proper O
Situation O
for O
a O
Fortress O

whose O
Garrison O
it O
could O
not O
subsist O
, O
will O
instead O
of O
being O
a O
desolate O
Frontier O
, O
soon O
become O
a O
flourishing O
Colony O
, O
thronged O
with O
a O
hardy O
Race O
of O
People O
, O
who O
by O
clearing O
away O
the O
Wood O
will O
soften O
the O
Rigour O
of O
the O
Climate O
, O
and O
find O
themselves O
richly O
overpaid O
in O
the O
inexhaustible O
Fertility O
of O
the O

It O
is O
not O
Rashness O
to O
foretell O
a O
similar O
Progress O

in O
the O

the O

thought O
so O
worthy O

if O

the O

they O

not O
be O
able O

by O
the O
tempting O

with O
which O
Uncertainty O
flatters O

seduces O
: O
On O
the O
other O
hand O

these O

there O

of O

been O
the O

themselves O

their O
Demand O

All O

With O
respect O
to O
East B-Location

, O
it O
has O
been O
so O
much O
the O
Subject O
of O
Conversation O
, O
Ridicule O

Dispute O
, O
that O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
form O
any O
very O
certain O
Ideas O
concerning O
it O
; O
yet O
that O
it O
is O
not O
known O
to O
those O
who O
depreciate O
it O
, O
is O
clear O
, O
from O
their O
Account O
of O
it O
: O
The O
Country B-Organization
they O
say O
can O
never O
be O
a O
flourishing O
Colony O
, O
for O
it O
is O
barren O

the O
greater O
Part O
of O
it O
is O
occupied O
by O
Tribes O
of O
Indians O
, O
more O
numerous O
and O
more O
fierce O
than O
any O
other O
in O
America B-Location
: O
The O
two O
Circumstances O
are O
absolutely O
inconsistent O
; O
for O
where O
the O
Indians O
are O
numerous O
, O
the O
Country O
must O
be O
fruitful O
: O
They O
who O
do O
not O
cultivate O
Land O

require O
much O
for O
their O
Subsistance O
; O
and O
if O
the O
natural O

are O
sufficient O
for O
such O
a O
Consumption O
, O
a O
populous O
Settlement O
may O
depend O
upon O
procuring O
Plenty O
by O
Culture O

But O
I O
believe O
the O
Fact O
to O
be O
, O
that O
the O
Eastern B-Location
Coasts I-Location
, O
which O
alone O
were O
formerly O
visited O
, O
are O
sandy O
and O
barren O
: O
More O

Accounts O
however O
represent O
the O
interior O
Parts O
of O
the O
Country B-Location
, O
as O
quite O
the O
Reverse O
; O
and O
at O
the O

Time O
the O
Indians O
, O
who O
possess O
it O

and O
who O
were O
once O
numerous O

are O
said O
to O
be O
greatly O
reduced O
in O
their O
Numbers O
: O
The O
Mulberry O

Orange O

, O
the O

the O
Indigo O

Cotton O
Plants O

wild O
in O
many O
Parts O

These O
it O
has O
in O
common O
with O
Georgia B-Location

South B-Location
Carolina I-Location
; O
but O
it O
has O
one O
Advantage O
over O
them O
, O
that O
being O
situated O
between O
two O

of O
the O

Excess O

to O
those O
sudden O

, O
by O
the O

in O

Both O

better O

any O

; O
and O
I O
am O
confident O
, O
will O
be O
found O
equal O
in O

to O
the O
best O
; O
to O
all O
which O
must O
be O
added O
, O
that O
as O
the O

is O
one O
of O
the O
first O
, O
but O
at O
the O

Time O
the O
most O
difficult O
, O
because O
the O
most O

Step O
to O

taken O
in O
a O

, O
this O
principal O
Object O
is O
already O
secured O
in O

the O

tho O
’ O

still O
large O
enough O
to O
obviate O
the O
Difficulties O

arising O
from O
the O
Want O

Countries O

where O
immediate O

is O
from O
the O
Fertility O
of O
the O

so O
certain O
; O

the O
Prospect O
of O
future O
Wealth O
is O
from O
their O
valuable O
Productions O

and O
their O

Trade O
so O
very O
flattering O
; O
and O
indeed O
I O
have O
heard O
some O
Persons O
esteem O
the O
Lands O
there O
so O
highly O
, O
as O
to O
think O
they O
ought O
to O
have O
been O
sold O
: O
But O
the O
Experiment O
would O
have O
been O
dangerous O
in O
Countries O
so O
little O
known O
, O
whose O
staple O
Commodities O
cannot O
be O
yet O
ascertained O
, O
and O
where O
Population O
is O
at O
present O
the O
principal O
Object O
: O
Perhaps O
hereafter O
it O
may O
be O
a O
point O
deserving O
Consideration O
, O
whether O
the O
publick O
should O
not O
avail O
itself O
of O
the O
Value O
of O
the O
Lands O
it O
has O
to O
dispose O
of O
: O
At O
present O
it O
seems O
quite O
sufficient O
to O
make O
this O
Advantage O
of O
those O
Lands O
only O
, O
which O
are O
to O
be O
exposed O
to O
Sale O
in O
the O
West-Indies B-Location
: O
for O
their O
Products O

their O
Culture O
are O
certain O
; O

they O
will O
find O
Purchasers O
, O
which O
the O
others O
probably O
might O
not O
to O
any O
sufficient O
Number O
. O

But O
I O
am O
very O
glad O
to O
see O
that O
the O
future O
Opulence O
of O
the O
two B-Location
Floridas I-Location
is O
so O
far O
already O
in O
Prospect O
, O
as O
to O
prevent O
the O

the O
Circumstances O

The O
Expence O
of O
two O

not O
to O

put O
in O
Competition O
with O
the O
Security O
that O
results O
from O
dividing O

Power O

which O
might O
hereafter O
become O

: O
We O
have O
not O
a O
better O
Pledge O
for O
the O
Dependance O
of O
the O

upon O
the O
Mother B-Organization

than O
that O
which O
arises O
from O
their O
being O
so O
many O

Unconnected O

by O

no O

’ O
the O

, O
may O
have O
hitherto O
rendered O
it O
impossible O

for O
it O
is O
a O
Work O
of O
Delicacy O

as O
an O

cannot O
easily O

the O
Opinion O
, O

from O

greatly O
promote O
the O

in O

a O

, O
almost O
opposite O
to O

The O
characteristic O
Distinctions O
, O
between O
the O
two B-Organization

, O
have O
been O
taken O
Notice O
of O
already O
; O
and O
the O
least O
Reflection O
upon O
those O
that O
have O
been O
mentioned O
, O
will O
satisfy O
a O
very O
cursory O
Observer O
, O
that O
more O
is O
requisite O
than O
merely O
to O
provide O
Inhabitants O
for O
the O
Islands B-Location
, O
where O
Property O
does O
not O
consist O
so O
much O
in O
Land O
, O
as O
in O
the O
Stock O
that O
is O
upon O
it O
; O
Conditions O
of O
Culture O
are O
annexed O
to O
the O
Sale O

and O
the O
strongest O
Pledge O
a O
Man O
can O
give O
of O
his O
having O
Substance O
sufficient O
for O
such O
a O
Cultivation O
, O
is O
his O
advancing O
Part O
of O
that O
Substance O
on O
the O
Speculation O
of O
the O
Profits O
he O
may O
make O
of O
it O
; O
for O
a O
Purchaser O
certainly O
thinks O
himself O
that O
he O
is O
, O
and O
most O
probably O
will O
be O
found O
to O
be O
equal O
to O
the O
Undertaking O
; O
no O
Precautions O
could O
have O
made O
Grantees O
equally O
responsible O
to O
the O
Public O
for O
the O
due O
Improvement O
of O
such O
valuable O
Property O
. O

The O
Objects O
of O
Acquisition O
would O
have O
been O
in O
reality O
so O
great O
, O
and O
in O
Appearance O
so O
much O
greater O
, O
that O
all O
Sorts O
of O
Impositions O
, O
Interest O
, O
and O
Importunity O
, O
would O
have O
been O
used O
, O
in O
order O
to O
obtain O
them O
; O
and O
where O
these O
had O
not O
prevailed O
, O
it O
would O
still O
have O
been O
impossible O
to O
fix O
the O
Proportions O
of O
the O
Allotments O
to O
the O
Abilities O
of O
the O
Petitioners O
; O
which O
will O
now O
be O
ascertained O
to O
some O
Degree O
of O
Accuracy O
by O
the O
private O
Interest O
of O
every O
Purchaser O
, O
as O
he O
must O
suffer O
himself O
if O
he O
exceeds O
the O
Bounds O
which O
his O
Fortune O
prescribes O
to O
him O
. O

But O
their O
Numbers O
would O
be O
small O
, O
if O
none O
were O
admitted O
who O
had O
not O
an O
immediate O
Command O
of O
Money O
, O
sufficient O
to O
answer O
all O
the O
Demands O
of O
such O

at O
once O
: O
The O
Buildings O
, O
the O
Negroes O
, O
the O

other O
Stock O
which O
are O

cost O
more O
than O
the O

themselves O
; O
and O
to O
enable O
the O
Purchaser O
to O
furnish O
themselves O
with O
these O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
relieve O
them O
in O
the O
Payment O
of O
the O

Money O
; O
Revenue O
itself O
is O
of O
less O
Consequence O
to O
the O
Public O
, O
even O
at O
this O
Crisis O
of O
Distress O
, O
than O
an O
effectual O
and O
speedy O

of O
these O
important O
Islands B-Location
. O

His O
Majesty B-Person
’ O
s O
Proclamation O
of O
the O
26th O
of O
March O
, O
has O
therefore O
declared O
, O
that O
the O
Lands O
shall O
be O
sold O
by O
publick O
Auction O
, O
and O
the O
Purchase-Money O
shall O
be O
paid O
in O
different O
Installments O
, O
Twenty O
per O
Cent O
. O

immediately O
at O
the O
time O
of O
Sale O
, O
Ten O
per O
Cent O
. O
within O
one O
Year O
afterwards O
, O
Ten O
per O
Cent O
. O
within O
the O
second O
Year O
, O
and O
Twenty O
per O
Cent O
. O
within O
every O
successive O
Year O
, O
until O
the O
whole O
is O
paid O
. O

But O
such O
an O
Indulgence O
would O
be O
Weakness O
, O
if O
Compliance O
with O
the O
Terms O
upon O
which O
it O
is O
granted O
, O
were O
not O
rigorously O
enforced O
; O
he O
who O
is O
guilty O
of O
a O
Breach O
of O
them O
, O
justly O
forfeits O
all O
Right O
to O
the O
Lands O
: O
and O
on O
that O
Condition O
he O
receives O
them O
. O

Another O
Indulgence O
is O
converting O
part O
of O
the O
Purchase O
Money O
into O
an O
Annual O
Quit O
Rent O
, O
the O
Value O
of O
which O
the O
Buyers O
will O
deduct O
out O
of O
the O
Purchase O
Money O
; O
and O
they O
will O
thereby O
have O
still O
more O
of O
their O
Capital O
at O
Liberty O
, O
to O
answer O
the O
Demand O
upon O
them O
, O
for O
Clearing O
and O
Stocking O
their O
Lands O
. O

This O
Charge O
too O
is O
levied O
with O
a O
Lenity O
perfectly O
corresponding O
with O
the O
Design O
of O
imposing O
it O
; O
it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
paid O
on O
the O
whole O
Lot O
at O
once O
; O
but O
is O
gradually O
to O
creep O
upon O
it O
, O
in O
proportion O
as O
it O
becomes O
valuable O
; O
the O
Quit O
Rents O
being O
declared O
by O
the O
Proclamation O
not O
to O
commence O
till O
Twelve O
Months O
after O
the O
time O
each O
Acre O
shall O
be O
cleared O
, O
in O
conformity O
to O
the O
Condition O
of O
Clearing O
, O
which O
I O
shall O
presently O
have O
occasion O
to O
mention O
. O

But O
still O
to O
enable O
Men O
to O
do O
Right O
, O
is O
not O
to O
oblige O
them O
to O
it O
: O
The O
same O
Means O
may O
also O
enable O
them O
to O
do O
Wrong O
, O
and O
then O
there O
will O
be O
more O
reason O
to O
expect O
an O
Abuse O
, O
than O
a O
proper O
Application O
of O
the O
Opportunity O
. O

Thus O
the O
Indulgences O
shewn O
to O
Purchasers O
with O
a O
View O
to O
assist O
them O
in O
improving O
their O
Lands O
, O
might O
be O
perverted O
to O
a O
quite O
contrary O
Effect O
, O
if O
no O
further O
Precautions O
were O
taken O
; O
for O
the O
Money O
thereby O
left O
in O
their O
Hands O
, O
might O
be O
and O
would O
be O
frequently O
employed O
only O
in O
enlarging O
their O
Purchases O
. O

All O
Tendencies O
to O
Monopoly O
are O
every O
where O
pernicious O
, O
unless O
Circumstances O
make O
them O
necessary O
: O
But O
in O
a O
new O
Colony O
they O
may O
be O
fatal O
; O
and O
must O
be O
detrimental O
: O
Too O
many O
Instances O
still O
subsisting O
of O
their O
mischievous O
Effects O
occur O
in O
several O
of O
the O
Colonies B-Location
, O
where O
large O
Tracts O
of O
Land O
, O
which O
the O
publick O
Benefit O
requires O
should O
be O
cleared O
and O
settled O
, O
are O
kept O
back O
from O
Sale O
by O
the O
Proprietors O
, O
on O
the O
prospect O
of O
their O
daily O
becoming O
more O
and O
more O
valuable O
: O
And O
after O
this O
Experience O
it O
would O
have O
been O
unpardonable O
, O
not O
to O
have O
provided O
against O
the O
Evil O
. O

The O
Division O
of O
the O
Lands O
into O
Allotments O
of O
between O
One O
Hundred O
and O
Five O
Hundred O
Acres O
, O
to O
which O
Dimensions O
it O
appears O
by O
the O
Proclamation O
they O
will O
in O
general O
be O
confined O
, O
must O
be O
a O
Means O
of O
preventing O
it O
: O
As O
one O
of O
the O
strongest O
Temptations O
to O
the O
extending O
of O
Territory O
, O
the O
Temptation O
of O
Contiguity O
, O
will O
thereby O
be O
often O
removed O
: O
Since O
a O
cheap O
Purchase O
of O
one O
Lot O
, O
will O
not O
at O
all O
secure O
an O
equally O
good O
Bargain O
for O
the O
next O
. O

The O
Prohibition O
against O
any O
one O
Man O
’ O
s O
buying O
more O
than O
Three O
Hundred O
Acres O
in O
Dominica B-Location
, O
or O
than O
Five O
Hundred O
in O
the O
other O
Islands B-Location
, O
will O
have O
a O
still O
greater O
Effect O
: O
The O
Restriction O
being O
enforced O
by O
the O
forfeiture O
of O
all O
the O
Land O
which O
he O
shall O
Purchase O
beyond O
those O
Numbers O
, O
and O
of O
the O
Money O
he O
shall O
have O
advanced O
for O
such O
Excess O
; O
I O
am O
not O
speaking O
of O
a O
few O
Acres O
too O
much O
, O
by O
the O
Mistake O
of O
the O
Surveyor O
, O
and O
unknown O
to O
the O
Purchaser O
: O
These O
cannot O
be O
liable O
to O
Forfeiture O
, O
for O
the O
Crown B-Organization
can O
never O
take O
Advantage O
of O
an O
Error O
in O
its O
own O
Officer O
, O
to O
subject O
another O
person O
to O
a O
Penalty O
: O
And O
such O
a O
Penalty O
can O
in O
no O
Case O
be O
extended O
beyond O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
Provision O
it O
is O
intended O
to O
enforce O
; O
which O
Provision O
in O
the O
present O
Case O
is O
against O
exceeding O
a O
specified O
Number O
of O
Acres O
: O
And O
the O
Excess O
therefore O
is O
all O
that O
can O
be O
affected O
by O
the O
Penalty O
: O
But O
the O
best O
Security O
of O
all O
arises O
from O
the O
Conditions O
of O
Culture O
: O
The O
Proclamation O
requires O
that O
five O
Acres O
in O
every O
Hundred O
be O
cleared O
, O
every O
Year O
till O
half O
the O
Lot O
is O
thereby O
brought O
into O
a O
state O
fit O
for O
Cultivation O
: O
But O
as O
Accidents O
and O
Disappointments O
may O
sometimes O
make O
it O
difficult O
to O
comply O
with O
this O
Condition O
, O
the O
Breach O
of O
it O
is O
not O
followed O
by O
so O
rigorous O
a O
Punishment O
as O
Forfeiture O
: O
A O
pecuniary O
Penalty O
of O
Five O
Pounds O
every O
Year O
for O
every O
Acre O
that O
is O
not O
cleared O
within O
the O
Term O
prescribed O
, O
is O
thought O
sufficient O
, O
as O
, O
no O
Man O
will O
continue O
to O
pay O
so O
much O
annually O
for O
unprofitable O
Lands O
, O
which O
he O
may O
make O
valuable O
by O
clearing O
. O

One O
other O
Condition O
is O
required O
, O
which O
will O
contribute O
both O
to O
the O
Improvement O
and O
to O
the O
Security O
of O
the O
Islanders O
: O
That O
every O
Purchaser O
of O
cleared O
Lands O
shall O
constantly O
keep O
upon O
his O
Lot O
, O
One O
White O
Man O
, O
or O
Two O
White O
Women O
, O
for O
every O
Hundred O
Acres O
contained O
in O
such O
Lot O
; O
and O
in O
default O
thereof O
, O
shall O
be O
subject O
to O
the O
Payment O
of O
Twenty O
Pounds O
per O

for O
every O
White O
Woman O
, O
and O
Forty O
Pounds O
for O
every O
White O

that O
shall O
be O

the O
Number O

Any O
one O
who O
has O
the O

is O
apprized O
of O
the O
Advantages O
arising O
from O
White O
Servants O
both O
for O
Service O
and O
for O
Security O
. O

The O
only O
Question O
with O
me O
is O
, O
whether O
the O
Penalty O
be O
heavy O
enough O
to O
enforce O
the O
Observance O
of O
the O
Condition O
; O
for O
in O
Antigua B-Location
and O
Barbadoes B-Location
, O
where O
a O

to O
be O
inadequate O

Very O
few O
of O
the O
Planters O
have O
their O
full O
Complement O
; O
instead O
of O
providing O
all O
, O
they O
pay O
the O
Penalty O
for O
some O
, O
which O
on O
every O
Estate O
are O
constantly O
deficient O
: O
And O
this O
is O
now O
got O
into O
so O
regular O
a O
Course O
, O
as O
to O
become O
a O
settled O
Fund O
of O
their O
Revenue O
; O
so O
that O
the O
Penalty O
instead O
of O
enforcing O
the O
Law O
, O
is O
perverted O
into O
a O
Mode O
of O
Taxation O
: O
That O
imposed O
by O
the O
Proclamation O
is O
indeed O
to O
be O
paid O
in O
Sterling O
Money O
, O
but O
whether O
the O
difference O
between O
that O
and O
Currency O
will O
be O
great O
enough O
, O
to O
make O
the O
same O
Regulation O
effectual O
in O
the O
one O
, O
which O
for O
want O
of O
being O
more O
strongly O
enforced O
, O
has O
not O
been O
observed O
in O
the O
other O
Colonies B-Location
, O
cannot O
be O
determined O
upon O
Speculation O
, O
but O
must O
be O
left O
to O
the O
decision O
of O
Time O
and O
Experiment O
. O

Yet O
even O
if O
it O
should O
compel O
all O
the O
Planters O
to O
keep O
their O
proper O
Number O
of O
White O
Servants O
, O
that O
Number O
would O
not O
amount O
to O
so O
many O
White O
Inhabitants O
, O
as O
the O
safety O
of O
the O

require O

The O
Invitation O
given O
to O
poor O

by O
Grants O
of O
from O
Ten O

Thirty O
Acres O
, O
will O
I O
hope O

the O

and O
the O
Expectation O
is O
so O
far O
well O
grounded O
, O
that O
a O
Policy O
similar O
to O
this O
has O
made O
Barbadoes B-Location
the O
best O

Island O
in O
all O
the O
West B-Location

The O

by O
making O
small O

such O
poor O

: O
Two O
of O
these O
are O
deemed O
equal O

by O
such O
a O
Substitution O
relieve O
from O

the O

they O
improve O

In O
these O

the O
White O

at O
the O

invited O
by O
the O
Provision O
that O

A O
small O

no O

it O

Some O

The O

indeed O

those O
by O

we O
are O
apt O

indiscriminately O

estimate O
West O

Such O
Inhabitants O

not O
expect O
to O
mimick O
the O
Opulence O
of O

; O
for O
the O
Lands O
allotted O
to O
them O
will O
hardly O
be O
of O
those O

are O
proper O
for O

But O
they O

raise O
Coffee O

; O
in O

of O

perhaps O
some O

: O
Whatever O
they O

be O
for O

A O
poor O

, O
who O
has O

ten O

will O
find O
himself O
greatly O
superior O
to O
any O
English O
Labourer O
; O
he O
that O

thirty O

that O

yet O
, O

is O

that O

is O

indeed O

a O

whether O

; O
on O
the O

are O
bad O
in O
their O
Origin O
, O
for O
the O
King B-Organization
of I-Organization
France I-Organization
could O
not O
grant O

Dominion O
; O

tho O
’ O
therefore O
they O

the O
Lands O

would O
be O

Lucia B-Location
, O
where O
great O
Encouragement O
is O
given O
to O
Settlers O
; O
and O
besides O
, O
Humanity O
revolts O
at O
the O
Idea O
of O
expelling O
from O
their O
Habitations O
, O
Men O
hitherto O
inoffensive O
, O
and O
who O
may O
never O
be O
pernicious O
, O
if O

be O
allowed O
them O
to O
familiarize O
themselves O
to O
the O
Customs O
and O
to O
adopt O
the O
Principles O
of O
their O
present O
Fellow-subjects O
. O

The O
Experiment O
at O
least O
should O
be O
made O
, O
and O
those O
who O
are O
inclined O
to O
stay O
should O
not O
be O
obliged O
to O
go O
, O
by O
being O
immediately O
and O
arbitrarily O
stripped O
of O
their O
Possessions O
; O
at O
the O

time O
they O
have O
no O
Pretence O
to O
expect O
that O
the O
Lands O
they O
wrongfully O
occupy O
, O
should O
be O
given O
to O
them O
, O
when O
the O
English O
can O
acquire O
no O
Property O
there O
but O
by O
Purchase O
. O

They O
cannot O
even O
require O
to O
be O
at O
once O
considered O
as O
Natives O
of O
Great B-Location
Britain I-Location
, O
and O
to O
be O
put O
on O
such O
a O
Footing O
, O
that O
the O
Government B-Organization
would O
have O
no O
Controul O
over O
them O
, O
should O
their O
Disaffection O
descend O
to O
future O
Generations O
. O

For O
these O
Reasons O
, O
I O
presume O
, O
it O
is O
, O
that O
a O
middle O
way O
is O
taken O
between O
confirming O
them O
in O
, O
and O
expelling O
them O
from O
their O
Possessions O
. O

The O
Proclamation O
declares O
that O
The O
Lands O
which O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
Surrender O
of O
these O
Islands B-Location
were O
, O
and O
still O
are O
in O
the O
Possession O
of O

upon O
certain O
Conditions O

under O
proper O
Restrictions O

By O
accepting O
this O
Offer O
, O
they O
will O
retain O
their O
Property O

under O
a O
better O
Title O
than O
they O
can O
pretend O
to O
now O
. O

This O
is O
alone O
a O
Favour O
; O

their O
subsequent O
Behaviour O
may O
intitle O
them O
to O
greater O
. O

What O
Number O

continue O

it O
is O
impossible O

The O
two O

to O
contain O
now O
about O
three O

French O
Inhabitants O

nine O

some O
will O
not O
forsake O
the O

these O
are O
certainly O
not O

tarry O

the O
Security O

of O
a O

These O
last O
will O
be O
as O

The O
whole O

only O
by O

from O

the O

So O
long O
therefore O

it O

the O

it O

them O

for O
there O

a O
certain O
Degree O
of O

convert O

Use O
the O

In O
the O
Article O
of O
Flax O

for O
Instance O
, O
which O
has O

the O

if O
there O

no O
Opportunity O

to O
spin O
them O
. O

Hitherto O
the O
Exportation O
has O
not O
been O
found O
to O
answer O
; O
and O
therefore O
the O
Farmers O
employ O
their O
Families O
in O
spinning O
, O
when O
the O
Rigour O
or O
Inclemency O
of O
the O

confine O
them O

: O
This O
is O
the O
real O
Foundation O
of O
their O
Linen O
Manufactory O
; O
They O
have O
hitherto O
proceeded O
no O
further O
than O
this O
has O
carried O
them O
; O
nor O
is O
it O
likely O
they O
should O
soon O
make O
a O
greater O
Progress O
; O
for O
even O
in O
Pensylvania B-Location
, O
where O
more O
Flax O

raised O
and O
more O
Weavers O
are O
settled O
, O
than O
in O
any O
other O
Province O
, O
common O
Labour O
is O
so O
dear O
, O
that O
if O
a O

cannot O
spin O
his O
own O
Flax O
in O
his O
own O
House O
, O
and O
by O
his O

, O
he O
will O
not O
find O
his O
Account O
in O

if O
that O
Expence O
falls O
upon O
him O
, O
he O
can O
supply O
himself O
cheaper O
with O
Linen O
from O
England B-Location
: O
So O
very O
small O
is O
the O
Advantage O
of O
Manufacturing O
for O
themselves O
, O
and O
so O
very O
confined O
is O
such O
a O

such O
a O

an O
Article O
of O

yet O
limited O
as O
it O

in O
its O
Nature O
, O
it O
will O
probably O
rather O
diminish O

increase O

now O
that O
the O
Parliament B-Organization
has O
granted O
a O
Bounty O
as O
abovementioned O
on O
the O
Importation O
of O

: O
The O
American O
Planter O
will O
no O
longer O
complain O
that O
his O
Flax O
Stalks O
must O
be O
wasted O
if O
he O

not O
Manufacture O
them O
: O
but O
a O
Vent O

Great B-Location

whither O
he O

this O
will O
probably O
be O

to O
be O
the O
most O

Manner O
of O

But O
there O
are O
more O
cogent O
Reasons O
still O
of O
a O
public O
Consideration O
against O
the O

the O

here O

very O
valuable O

a O

still O
remains O
improveable O
to O
any O
considerable O

by O

so O
that O
the O

the O
Inhabitants O

the O

The O

And O
the O
necessary O
Consequence O
from O
the O

is O
, O
that O
neither O

Lands O

the O
one O

Should O
then O
the O

the O

The O

the O

sufficent O

without O

that O

all O

, O
to O
an O
Extent O
that O

alarming O
to O
Great B-Organization

, O
must O
prove O
abortive O
in O
the O
End O
; O
at O
least O
, O
the O
additional O
Duty O
upon O
Linens O
affords O
no O
Ground O
for O
such O
Apprehensions O
: O
it O
is O
but O
half O
a O
Subsidy O
that O
is O
imposed O
, O
which O
is O
too O
inconsiderable O
upon O
the O
whole O
to O
make O
a O
material O
Difference O
: O
the O
Tax O
it O
is O
true O
, O
falls O
unequally O
, O
as O
Linens O
of O
very O
different O
Prices O
pay O
the O

Duty O
, O
being O
comprehended O
under O
the O
general O
Denomination O
of O
Narrow O
Germans O
. O

This O
is O
a O
Grievance O
that O
is O
equally O
felt O
in O
Great B-Location
Britain I-Location
, O
and O
which O
I O
hope O
will O
be O
thought O
deserving O
of O
a O
Remedy O
: O
Could O
a O
Line O
of O
Distinction O
be O
drawn O
between O
the O
finer O
and O
coarser O
Linens O
, O
that O
are O
now O
included O
within O
the O
same O
Description O
, O
and O
such O
I O
should O
think O
it O
would O
not O
be O
impossible O
for O
Persons O
engaged O
in O
that O
Trade O
to O
draw O
, O
I O
flatter O
myself O
that O
it O
would O
be O
adopted O
: O
but O
in O
the O
mean O
while O
, O
the O
Americans O
have O
no O
greater O
Reason O
to O
complain O
than O
the O
English O
of O
this O
Disproportion O
; O
and O
as O
to O
the O
actual O
Duty O
required O
of O
them O
, O
they O
must O
still O
consider O
themselves O
as O
favoured O
, O
not O
oppressed O
, O
when O
they O
reflect O
that O
upon O
the O
cheapest O
of O
these O
Linens O
, O
those O
on O
which O
the O
Duty O
is O
most O
burthensome O
, O
the O
old O
Subsidy O
is O
but O
about O
Three O
Shillings O
, O
and O
Nine-pence O
Three O
Farthings O
upon O
a O
Hundred O

Twenty O
Ells O

is O
all O
that O
they O
are O
now O

half O
of O

by O
the O

about O
One O

One O

Four-pence O

which O
is O
a O
greater O

Should O
there O

as O
on O

the O

will O
allow O

I O

Laws O
to O

no O

thwart O
all O

It O
has O

that O
the O
only O
Circumstance O
which O

to O
manufacture O
Linens O
cheaper O
than O
he O
can O
buy O
them O
when O

from O

, O
is O
because O
he O
does O
not O

this O
was O
the O
Case O
under O
the O
Duty O
of O
half O
the O

Should O
it O
for O
the O
Sake O

supposed O
, O
( O
tho O
’ O
I O
cannot O
believe O

that O
the O
additional O

turn O

Spinning O

cheaper O
than O
it O
can O
be O

; O
which O
is O
the O
most O
that O
can O
be O
apprehended O
; O
it O
will O
always O
be O
in O
the O
Power O
of O
Great B-Organization

to O
reinstate O
Things O
where O
they O

and O
if O
the O

caused O
an O
Alteration O
, O
the O
taking O
off O
that O
Duty O
must O
necessarily O
restore O
the O

Linens O
to O
their O
former O
Price O
, O
which O
is O
lower O
than O

afford O
them O
for O

Hand O

a O
Bounty O

taken O

the O
Act O

a O
Duty O
of O
Two O

of O

Six-pence O

This O
indeed O
is O
a O
considerable O
Rise O
upon O
the O
half O

amounted O
to O
no O
more O

Four O

it O
hardly O
yet O
exceeds O
a O
Third O
of O
the O
Duty O
that O
was O
charged O
upon O
them O
, O
while O
their O

was O
permitted O

on O

as O
the O
Interests O

required O

for O
such O

the O
Delicacy O

themselves O

by O
a O
much O
heavier O

I O

No O

as O
to O
be O

substituted O

the O
advanced O
Price O
will O
not O
raise O
them O
to O
a O
Value O

extravagant O
for O
such O
Purchasers O
; O
but O
should O
it O
be O
said O
that O
the O
Dutch O
will O
now O
be O
able O
to O
furnish O
them O
at O
a O

; O
the O
Answer O
is O
, O
that O
the O

have O
been O
long O
imported O
by O
our O

that O

Treaty O
of O

, O
with O
respect O

the O

will O
in O
this O

that O

as O

the O

such O

the O

The O

the O

no O

co-operating O

The O

for O
it O

not O

the O
Consumption O
of O
Commodities O

of O
which O
we O
must O
wish O

only O
that O
those O

can O
afford O
to O
indulge O

such O
Delicacies O

should O
contribute O
something O

if O
the O

further O

be O

in O

the O

The O
Intention O
of O
the O
Legislature O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
to O
encourage O
the O
raising O
of O
Coffee O
in O
our O
West B-Location
India I-Location
Islands I-Location
, O
by O
giving O
it O
an O
Advantage O
over O
that O
produced O
in O
foreign O

, O
upon O
every O
Hundred O
Weight O
of O
which O
a O
Duty O
of O
Two O
Pounds O
Nineteen O
Shillings O
and O
Nine-pence O
is O
by O
the O

Act O
imposed O
. O

So O
great O
a O
Difference O
of O
Duty O
upon O
a O
Hundred O
Weight O
, O
the O
prime O
Cost O
of O
which O
will O
not O
exceed O
Three O
Pounds O
, O
must O
give O
a O
Preference O
to O
our O
own O
Produce O
, O
which O
is O
particularly O
recommended O
to O
Public O
Encouragement O
, O
by O
the O
Circumstances O
of O
being O
raised O
with O
less O
Expence O

, O
and O
therefore O
within O
the O
Reach O
of O
the O
first O
Settlers O
in O
the O

Islands I-Location
. O

The O
same O
Reason O
holds O
, O
and O
perhaps O
more O
strongly O
, O
with O
respect O
to O
Indigo O
, O
which O
, O
if O
imported O
from O
foreign O

into O
any O
of O
our O

is O
by O
the O
Act O
so O
frequently O

a O
Duty O
of O
Sixpence O

, O
while O
our O
own O

Indigo O
is O
a O
Commodity O
, O
which O
particularly O
attracts O
our O
Notice O
at O
this O
Juncture O
; O
great O
Quantities O
of O
it O
used O
to O
be O
raised O
in O
our O
West B-Location
India I-Location
Islands I-Location
, O
but O
for O
many O
Years O
very O
little O
has O
been O
produced O
; O
and O
we O
have O
been O
in O
a O
great O
Measure O
supplied O
by O
the O
French O
. O

The O
Reason O
of O
this O
has O
not O
been O
, O
( O
as O
is O
commonly O
supposed O
, O
) O
the O
high O
Duties O
that O
were O
laid O
upon O
it O
, O
but O
the O
clearing O
of O
the O
Country O
; O
for O
Indigo O
is O
a O
Plant O
that O
requires O
Moisture O
, O
which O
nothing O
can O
secure O
in O
those O
torrid O
Climates O
, O
but O
the O
Proximity O
of O
Mountains O
to O
break O
the O
Clouds O
in O
their O
Passage O

of O
Woods O
from O
whence O

refresh O
the O

: O
as O
the O

have O
been O
cut O
away O
, O
this O
Resource O
has O
gradually O
failed O
, O
and O
the O
Produce O
of O
Indigo O
, O
which O
depended O
upon O
it O
, O
has O
declined O
in O
Proportion O
. O

The O
West O
Indians O
regret O
but O
little O
the O
Loss O
of O
a O
Commodity O
, O
which O
has O
made O
way O
for O
a O
greater O
Cultivation O
of O
their O
favourite O
Produce O
, O
Sugar O
; O
but O
the O
Nation B-Organization
must O
sensibly O
feel O
the O
Inconvenience O
of O
being O
furnished O
from O
other O
Countries O

with O
so O
valuable O
an O
Article O
of O
Commerce O
, O
and O
so O
necessary O
a O
Material O
of O

This O
Consideration O
has O
induced O
some O
Planters O
in O
South B-Location
Carolina I-Location
to O
attempt O
to O
raise O
it O
there O
, O
and O
they O
have O
already O
succeeded O
so O
far O
as O
to O
prove O
, O
that O
the O
Soil O

the O
Climate O
agree O
with O
the O

and O
that O
they O
are O

the O
Art O

the O

so O
as O
to O
equal O
the O

The O
great O
Losses O
they O
sustained O
by O
the O
Captures O
of O
their O

, O
have O
a O
little O
retarded O
their O
Progress O
: O
but O
now O
that O
Peace O

restored O
, O
there O
is O
reason O
to O
expect O
that O
this O
Cultivation O
will O
flourish O
, O
and O
even O
be O
extended O
to O
Georgia B-Location

the O
two B-Location

which O
are O
rather O
better O

cheaper O
than O
any O
that O

be O

By O

. O
a O
Duty O
of O
Six-pence O
per O

was O
laid O
upon O
all O
foreign O
Melasses O
; O
but O
such O
has O
been O
the O
Disregard O
of O
all O
Revenue O
Laws O
in O
America B-Location
, O
that O
this O
has O
produced O
hardly O
any O
Thing O
, O
tho O
’ O
the O
Commodity O
has O
been O
imported O
all O
the O
time O
in O
great O
Quantities O
. O

Instead O
of O
paying O
the O
Duty O
, O
a O
regular O
Course O
has O
been O
fallen O
into O
of O
importing O
it O
free O
of O
any O
; O
and O
the O
Expence O
of O
such O
Smuggling O
has O
been O
brought O
to O
a O
Certainty O
of O
about O
Three O
Half-pence O
a O
Gallon O
; O
which O
was O
a O
Charge O
upon O
the O
raw O
Materials O
before O
it O
came O
to O
the O
Manufacturer O
, O
amounting O
to O
one O
Fourth O
of O
the O
Duty O
, O
and O
destructive O
of O
the O
whole O
: O
under O
this O
Charge O
the O
Distilleries O
of O
North B-Location
America I-Location
have O
flourished O
to O
a O
surprizing O
Degree O
; O
and O
surely O
it O
is O
to O
be O
wished O
that O
the O
Burthen O
now O
upon O
the O
Merchandize O
, O
should O
yield O
a O
Revenue O
to O
the O
Publick O
instead O
of O
a O
Profit O
to O
Smugglers O
, O
or O
which O
is O
worse O
, O
to O
Officers O
of O
the O
Crown B-Organization
conniving O
at O
Smugglers O
: O
but O
it O
has O
been O
said O
that O
the O
excessive O
high O
Duty O
, O
imposed O
by O
the O
6 O
Geo O
. O

II O
. O
was O
the O
Cause O
of O
the O
Smuggling O
, O
and O
that O
nothing O
will O
put O
a O
Stop O
to O
it O
but O
reducing O
the O
Tax O
. O

The O
Fact O
is O
probable O
; O
the O
Legislature B-Organization
seem O
to O
have O
thought O
that O
the O
Load O
was O
heavier O
than O
the O
Trade O
could O
bear O
; O
and O
have O
therefore O
reduced O
it O
from O
Sixpence O
to O
Three-pence O
per O
Gallon O
: O
this O
still O
is O
represented O
by O
some O
as O
too O
high O
; O
and O
indeed O
whatever O
Rate O
is O
fixed O
, O
will O
in O
all O
Probability O
be O
censured O
by O
those O
whom O
it O
affects O
; O
but O
so O
far O
is O
certain O
, O
that O
a O
Duty O
may O
always O
exceed O
the O
Expence O
of O
Smuggling O
; O
for O
no O
Man O
will O
expose O
his O
Character O
to O
Reflection O
, O
and O
his O
Property O
to O
Hazards O
, O
without O
the O
Temptation O
of O
Advantages O
over O
the O
fair O
Trader O
. O

And O
as O
Three O
Half-pence O
per O
Gallon O
was O
the O
Expence O
of O
Smuggling O
, O
while O
a O
general O
Relaxation O
of O
the O
Laws O
against O
it O
prevailed O
over O
all O
that O
Continent B-Location
, O
now O
that O
these O
Laws O
are O
rigorously O
put O
into O
Execution O
, O
that O
Charge O
will O
be O
higher O
in O
Proportion O
to O
the O
additional O
Risque O
of O
Seizures O
; O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
the O
Temptation O
is O
less O
by O
the O
Difference O
between O
Three-pence O
and O
Six-pence O
. O

These O
Reasons O
concur O
to O
prove O
that O
a O
Duty O
considerably O
higher O
than O
Three O
Half-pence O
per O
Gallon O
may O
be O
imposed O
upon O
Melasses O
, O
without O
being O
, O
by O
its O
Excess O
, O
an O
Inducement O
to O
Smuggling O
. O

The O
next O
Question O
is O
, O
what O
the O
Trade O
can O
bear O
without O
being O
oppressed O
by O
it O
: O
It O
certainly O
can O
bear O
more O
now O
it O
is O
established O
, O
than O
it O
could O
in O
its O
Beginnings O
; O
it O
has O
thriven O
, O
it O
has O
increased O
, O
it O
continues O
to O
increase O
, O
under O
a O
Charge O
of O
Three O
Half-pence O
per O
Gallon O
; O
and O
as O
Experience O
has O
shewn O
that O
it O
can O
support O
such O
a O
Burthen O
, O
with O
Ease O
, O
the O
Presumption O
is O
from O
thence O
alone O
very O
strong O
, O
that O
it O
is O
equal O
to O
a O
greater O
without O
Inconvenience O
. O

The O
additional O
Charge O
upon O
the O
Commodity O
, O
by O
the O
Duty O
of O
Three-pence O
, O
is O
but O
Three O
Half-pence O
, O
so O
much O
only O
being O
the O
Difference O
between O
the O
former O
and O
the O
present O
Price O
of O
Importation O
: O
and O
as O
a O
Gallon O
of O
Melasses O
produces O
a O
Gallon O
of O
Rum O
, O
an O
Addition O
of O
Three O
Halfpence O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
us O
a O
severe O
Tax O
upon O
a O
Gallon O
of O
Rum O
. O

The O
cheapest O
Spirits O
that O
are O
drawn O
in O
England B-Location
, O
pay O
a O
Duty O
of O
One O
Shilling O
and O
Five-pence O
Half-penny O
per O
Gallon O
to O
the O
Publick O
; O
and O
to O
expect O
that O
our O
fellow O
Subjects O
should O
contribute O
Three-pence O
per O
Gallon O
for O
their O
Consumption O
of O
the O
same O
Commodity O
, O
is O
surely O
not O
very O
unreasonable O
; O
so O
much O
therefore O
of O
the O
Produce O
of O
their O
Distilleries O
as O
is O
necessary O
for O
supplying O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
themselves O
, O
is O
certainly O
not O
taxed O
beyond O
what O
it O
ought O
to O
be O
. O

But O
it O
is O
alledged O
that O
the O
Fishery O
, O
the O
Guinea O
, O
and O
the O
Indian O
Trade O
cannot O
support O
the O
consequential O
Rise O
upon O
Spirituous O
Liquors O
, O
and O
that O
both O
the O
Distilleries O
and O
these O
Branches O
of O
Commerce O
will O
sink O
under O
the O
Burthen O
together O
. O

The O
Demand O
for O
the O
Fisheries O
is O
not O
to O
furnish O
the O
American O
Ships O
only O
, O
but O
to O
supply O
those O
also O
that O
are O
sent O
for O
the O
Purposes O
of O
fishing O
from O
Great B-Organization
Britain I-Organization
, O
and O
do O
not O
carry O
out O
with O
them O
sufficient O
Store O
of O
Spirituous O
Liquors O
. O

Whatever O
Quantity O
the O
latter O
take O
from O
the O
American O
is O
a O
Loss O
to O
the O
British O
Distilleries O
; O
and O
if O
the O
Effect O
of O
this O
Duty O
should O
be O
to O
diminish O
that O
Quantity O
, O
I O
cannot O
see O
any O
great O
national O
Mischief O
that O
would O
attend O
it O
, O
because O
I O
cannot O
admit O
that O
any O
Manufactures O
should O
be O
encouraged O
in O
the O
Colonies B-Location
, O
to O
the O
Prejudice O
of O
those O
established O
in O
the O
Mother B-Location
Country I-Location
. O

As O
to O
the O
Rum O
used O
on O
board O
the O
American O
Ships O
, O
that O
is O
a O
Kind O
of O
home O
Consumption O
; O
the O
Duty O
is O
but O
an O
inconsiderable O
Addition O
to O
the O
whole O
Expence O
of O
the O
Trade O
, O
and O
is O
certainly O
not O
too O
much O
for O
it O
to O
bear O
, O
as O
the O
same O
Trade O
carried O
on O
by O
Ships O
from O
hence O
, O
which O
take O
in O
sufficient O
Store O
here O
, O
does O
in O
this O
Article O
actually O
bear O
a O
greater O
; O
surely O
the O
Americans O
have O
Advantages O
enough O
by O
their O
Situation O
with O
respect O
to O
the O
Fisheries O
, O
not O
to O
make O
it O
necessary O
to O
give O
their O
Manufactures O
the O
Preference O
to O
our O
own O
, O
in O
order O
to O
enable O
them O
to O
fish O
on O
Terms O
still O
so O
much O
better O
. O

As O
to O
the O
Trade O
upon O
the O
Coast B-Location
of I-Location

, O
that O
is O
no O
longer O
a O
Matter O
of O
Speculation O
: O
the O
Experiment O
has O
been O
made O
already O
of O
advancing O
the O
Price O
of O
American O

there O
, O
and O
has O
succeeded O
. O

Their O
Rum O
used O
to O
be O
cheaper O
tho O
’ O
but O
a O
little O
cheaper O
than O
the O
British O
Spirits O
on O
the O
Coast B-Location
, O
but O
was O
always O
greatly O
prefered O
by O
the O
Natives O
, O
not O
on O
Account O
of O
the O
Difference O
of O
Price O
, O
but O
of O
its O
more O
fiery O
Quality O
, O
which O
made O
it O
more O
acceptable O
to O
the O

. O

The O
British O
Spirits O
are O
sold O
on O
the O
Coast B-Location
of I-Location
Guinea I-Location
at O
about O
One O
Shilling O
and O
Two-pence O
Half-penny O
per O
Gallon O
; O
the O
American O
used O
to O
be O
sold O
at O
about O
One O
Shilling O
and O
Two-pence O
: O
but O
on O
the O
Alarm O
, O
occasioned O
last O
Year O
by O
the O
Establishment O
of O
Cutters O
, O
to O
enforce O
the O
Collection O
of O
the O
Six-penny O
Duty O
, O
which O
then O
subsisted O
, O
the O
American O
Merchants O
suddenly O
raised O
their O
Price O
from O
One O
Shilling O
and O
Two-pence O
to O
One O
Shilling O
and O
Six-pence O
per O
Gallon O
, O
and O
yet O
preserved O
the O
Preference O
given O
by O
the O

to O
their O
Spirits O
. O

The O
Rise O
was O
made O
on O
the O
Presumption O
that O
thc O
Six-penny O
Duty O
would O
be O
levied O
; O
at O
that O
Time O
the O
Reduction O
to O
Three-pence O
was O
not O
foreseen O
, O
for O
they O
never O
would O
have O
required O
Four-pence O
of O
the O
Consumers O
to O
enable O
them O
to O
defray O
an O
additional O
Expence O
of O
Three O
Half-pence O
only O
upon O
the O
Commodity O
: O
they O
may O
now O
lower O
it O
again O
; O

on O
the O

at O
Two O
Shillings O

Three-pence O

the O

will O
be O
the O

as O
when O
he O
sold O
for O
Two O

; O
and O
he O
may O
depend O
on O
the O
Preference O
being O
given O
to O
the O
American O

since O
it O
was O
given O
when O
they O
were O
at O

at O
Two O
Shillings O

Two-pence O
Half-penny O

As O
to O
the O
Indian O

the O
Americans O
have O
it O
much O
more O
to O
themselves O
; O
there O
they O
have O
no O
Competitors O
to O
apprehend O
; O
and O
the O
poor O

I O

such O
nice O

there O

a O
larger O
Proportion O

they O
were O

They O
will O
sink O

lower O

when O

yields O
much O
larger O

that O
the O
Reason O
why O
our O

is O
only O
because O

The O
Sugar O
itself O

which O
these O

be O
a O
further O
Diminution O
of O

of O

upon O

in O
such O

Act O

cannot O

by O
the O

, O
so O

as O

Consumption O

it O
, O
since O
the O
Inhabitants O

chearfully O
submitted O

like O
Regulation O

for O
the O
Benefit O
of O
the O
West B-Location

have O
laid O
a O
much O
higher O
Duty O
upon O
French O
than O
upon O
British O
Sugars O
imported O
into O
Great B-Location
Britain I-Location
: O
but O
it O
is O
objected O
to O
this O
Tax O
, O
that O
it O
will O
hurt O
the O
Trade O
of O
the O
North O
Americans O
, O
as O
Carriers O
of O
the O
French O
Sugars O
to O
Europe B-Location
; O
a O
Trade O
profitable O
in O
itself O
, O
and O
promoting O
Navigation O
; O
on O
which O
Accounts O
it O
is O
said O
, O
a O
Drawback O
of O
great O
Part O
or O
of O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
Duty O
, O
should O
be O
allowed O
on O
Re-exportation O

Could O
this O
be O
done O
without O
opening O
Opportunities O
for O
the O
greatest O
Frauds O
on O
the O
Revenue O
, O
it O
might O
be O
proper O
; O
but O
it O
is O
well O
known O
that O
no O
Indulgence O
to O
Trade O
is O
so O
much O
abused O
to O
the O
prejudice O
, O
both O
of O
the O
Revenue O
and O
of O
Commerce O
, O
as O
the O
Allowance O
of O
Drawbacks O
here O
; O
and O
it O
will O
be O
liable O
to O
greater O
Abuses O
in O
America B-Location
, O
unless O
some O
more O
effectual O
Method O
than O
has O
hitherto O
been O
practised O
, O
could O
be O
found O
to O
prevent O
them O
: O
and O
after O
all O
it O
remains O
to O
be O
proved O
, O
that O
the O
Object O
is O
great O
enough O
to O
justify O
the O
dangerous O
Experiment O
of O
making O
in O
any O
Shape O
an O
Allowance O
of O
a O
Drawback O
; O
the O
North O
Americans O
had O
indeed O
formerly O
the O
Carriage O
of O
the O
French O
Sugars O
to O
a O
considerable O
Amount O
; O
but O
the O
French O
have O
for O
many O
Years O
carried O
the O
greater O
Part O
themselves O
. O

This O
Duty O
too O
, O
it O
must O
be O
observed O
, O
is O
only O
on O
the O
White O
and O
the O
Clay O
’ O
d O
, O
that O
is O
, O
the O
manufactured O
Sugars O
: O
the O
Effect O
of O
it O
may O
be O
in O
some O
Degree O
, O
to O
induce O
the O
French O
to O
send O
their O
Sugars O
in O
a O
lower O
State O
of O
Manufacture O
to O
North B-Location
America I-Location
, O
and O
then O
they O
will O
be O
free O
of O
Duty O
: O
the O
Carriage O
of O
these O
is O
not O
affected O
: O
as O
to O
the O
Carriage O
of O
the O
others O
, O
if O
what O
is O
left O
of O
that O
Trade O
could O
be O
retained O
without O
exposing O
the O
Revenue O
and O
the O
fair O
Trader O
to O
Losses O
, O
they O
ought O
to O
be O
free O
from O
, O
it O
certainly O
would O
be O
proper O
to O
do O
it O
; O
the O
only O
Doubt O
is O
whether O
it O
be O
possible O
. O

These O
are O
the O
several O
Duties O
imposed O
by O
Parliament B-Organization
during O
the O
last O
Sessions O
, O
upon O
the O
Consumption O
of O

; O
and O
they O
appear O
to O
have O
been O
judiciously O
chosen O
, O
not O
only O
with O
a O
View O
to O
the O
Revenue O
, O
which O
they O
will O
produce O
; O
but O
for O
other O
, O
and O
in O
my O
Opinion O
, O
greater O
political O
Purposes O
, O
which O
each O
of O
them O
will O
respectively O
answer O
; O
and O
besides O
those O
already O
mentioned O
, O
there O
is O
one O
general O
Effect O
that O
will O
result O
from O
the O
whole O
, O
which O
will O
be O
of O
the O
utmost O
Importance O
to O
the O
Trade O
of O
Great B-Organization
Britain I-Organization
, O
and O
to O
the O
Connection O
between O
her O
and O
her O
Colonies B-Organization
; O
tho O
’ O
the O
Duties O
are O
very O
low O
, O
the O
Articles O
on O
which O
they O
are O
laid O
are O
numerous O
, O
and O
comprehend O
all O
that O
have O
been O
the O
Subjects O
of O
a O
contraband O
Trade O
, O
with O
those O
Parts O
of O
Europe B-Organization
which O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
are O
not O
allowed O
to O
trade O
to O
. O

The O
bringing O
these O
to O
a O
regular O
Entry O
and O
Account O
, O
will O
be O
the O
Means O
of O
detecting O
and O
of O
preventing O
the O
illicit O
Proceedings O
that O
have O
hitherto O
prevailed O
; O
and O
not O

maintain O

improve O
the O
Commerce O

both O
of O

the O
Merchandize O
should O
be O

neither O
. O

In O
other O
Countries O
Customhouse O
Duties O
are O
for O
the O
most O
Part O
, O
little O
more O
than O
a O
Branch O
of O
the O
Revenue O
: O
In O
the O
Colonies B-Location
they O
are O
a O
political O
Regulation O
, O

enforce O
the O
Observance O
of O
those O

to O
which O
the O
great O
Increase O
of O
our O
Trade O

Power O
are O
principally O
owing O
. O

The O
Aim O
of O
those O
Laws O
is O
to O
confine O
the O
European O
Commerce O
of O
the O

to O
the O
Mother B-Organization

to O
provide O

be O
exported O
either O
to O
Great B-Location

to O

to O
secure O
the O

of O
all O
American O
Exports O

Imports O
to O
British O
Ships O

British O
Subjects O
only O

It O
is O
the O
Policy O
of O
every O
Nation O
to O
prohibit O
all O
foreign O
Trade O
with O
their O
Plantations O
: O
it O
has O
been O
the O
Policy O
of O
this O
almost O
as O
far O
back O
as O
we O
have O
had O
any O
Colonies O
worth O
regarding O
; O
the O
first O
and O
great O
Act O
of O

being O
nearly O
co-æval O
with O
their O
Existence O
as O
a O
People O
; O
before O
that O
Time O
the O

the O
Inhabitants O

a O
few O

to O
enjoy O
their O
civil O

they O
were O

The O
Distractions O

indeed O
increased O

The O

of O
this O

The O

As O
to O
the O

I O
suppose O
it O
is O
very O
difficult O

not O
impossible O
to O

any O
Calculation O
of O
its O
Amount O
: O
I O
will O
not O

Conjecture O
upon O
it O
, O
as O
I O
cannot O
presume O
that O
I O
should O
be O
right O
; O
and O
I O
should O
be O
sorry O
to O
be O
wrong O
. O

Thus O
far O
however O
may O
be O
safely O
affirmed O
, O
that O
Duties O
so O
low O
, O
and O
now O
first O
laid O
, O
will O
not O
at O
present O
contribute O
largely O
to O
the O
Exigencies O
of O
the O
Public O
; O
for O
inconsiderable O
as O
they O
are O
, O
the O
Payment O
of O
them O
will O
be O
often O
avoided O
by O
Frauds O
and O
Subtilties O
, O
which O
no O
Penetration O
can O
foresee O
, O
and O
Experience O
only O
can O
discover O
and O
prevent O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
they O
will O
be O
an O
improving O
Revenue O
; O
because O
they O
are O
laid O
upon O
numerous O
Articles O
of O
general O
Consumption O
among O
an O
encreasing O
People O
; O
and O
if O
not O
productive O
of O
a O
great O
Fund O
immediately O
, O
will O
be O
at O
least O
a O
wide O
Foundation O
for O
a O
considerable O
future O
Revenue O
; O
but O
upon O
no O
Calculation O
can O
it O
be O
supposed O
to O
be O
equal O
to O
the O
Demand O
that O
must O
be O
made O
upon O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
; O
and O
therefore O
a O
further O
Tax O
has O
been O
proposed O
; O
it O
has O
been O
even O
resolved O
by O
a O
Vote O
of O
the O
House B-Organization
of I-Organization
Commons I-Organization
, O
that O
it O
may O
be O
proper O
to O
charge O
certain O
Stamp O
Duties O
in O
the O

; O
and O
here O
the O
Legislature O
stoped O
last O
Sessions O
out O
of O
Tenderness O
to O
the O
Colonies B-Organization

A O
Stamp O
Duty O
, O
tho O
’ O
often O
used O
in O
the O
Plantations B-Location
for O
the O
Purposes O
of O
their O
own O
Government O
, O
has O
never O
been O
imposed O
there O
by O
Authority O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
, O
and O
time O
has O
been O
therefore O
very O
properly O
allowed O
, O
to O
enquire O
whether O
it O
will O
be O
attended O
with O
any O
Inconveniences O
, O
and O
to O
provide O
Expedients O
of O
Prevention O
or O
Remedy O
; O
but O
I O
believe O
the O
more O
it O
is O
examined O
, O
so O
much O
the O
more O
clearly O
will O
it O
appear O
, O
that O
this O
Mode O
of O
Taxation O
is O
the O
easiest O
, O
the O
most O
equal O
and O
the O
most O
certain O
that O
can O
be O
chosen O
: O
The O
Duty O
falls O
chiefly O
upon O
Property O
; O
but O
it O
is O
spread O
lightly O
over O
a O
great O
Variety O
of O
Subjects O
, O
and O
lies O
heavy O
upon O
none O
: O
The O
Act O
executes O
itself O
by O
annulling O
the O
Instruments O
that O
have O
not O
paid O
the O
small O
Sums O
they O
are O
charged O
with O
; O
and O
the O
Tax O
thus O
supported O
and O
secured O
, O
is O
collected O
by O
few O
Officers O
, O
without O
Expence O
to O
the O
Crown B-Organization

or O
Oppression O
on O

The O
Revenue O
that O

the O
Duties O
which O
have O
been O
already O
, O
or O
by O
these O
if O
they O
should O
be O
hereafter O
imposed O

all O
equally O
applied O
by O

towards O

the O

the O
British B-Location

Not O
that O

the O

of O
the O
Resolution O

If O

the O
Consequence O

the O

that O

which O
the O

provide O

A O

of O
this O

; O
the O
Necessity O
for O
it O
, O
the O
Extent O

the O
Application O
of O
it O

are O
Matters O
which O
Councils B-Organization
limited O
in O
their O
Views O

properly O
judge O
of O
; O
and O
when O
therefore O
the O
national B-Organization
Council I-Organization
determine O
these O
Particulars O
, O
it O
does O
not O
encroach O
on O
the O
other O

a O
Power O

that O

The O

on O

conscious O
of O
its O
own O
Inability O
to O
answer O
greater O
Purposes O

those O
for O
which O
it O
was O
instituted O
, O
it O
leaves O
the O

The O
Exertion O
of O
that O
Authority O
which O
belongs O
to O
its O
universal O

, O
neither O
lowers O
the O
Dignity O

depreciates O
the O
Usefulness O

all O
that O

The O
Concurrence O
therefore O
of O
the O

be O
necessary O
in O
great O
public O

none O

The O

must O
tax O
the O

The O

From O

from O
many O
others O
which O

occur O
upon O

This O
Vote O

closed O
the O
Measures O
taken O
last O

on O
the O
