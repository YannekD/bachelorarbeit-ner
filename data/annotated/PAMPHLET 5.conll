Martin B-Person
Howard I-Person
Jr I-Person
. I-Person
was O
a O
prominent O
and O
well-to-do O
lawyer O
closely O
tied O
to O
the O
Anglican O
merchant O
community O
of O
Newport B-Location
, O
Rhode B-Location
Island I-Location
. O

His O
pamphlet O
, O
a O
point-by-point O
response O
to O
Hopkins B-Person
’ O
s O
Rights O
of O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
Examined O
, O
was O
one O
of O
the O
first O
and O
boldest O
defenses O
of O
British O
policy O
and O
parliamentary O
authority O
by O
an O
American O
. O

But O
Howard B-Person
and O
his O
Newport O
clique O
, O
which O
Otis B-Person
called O
a O
“ O
little O
, O
dirty O
, O
drinking O
, O
drabbing O
, O
contaminated O
knot O
of O
thieves O
, O
” O
were O
not O
simply O
interested O
in O
defending O
the O
Sugar O
and O
Stamp O
Acts O
and O
the O
new O
trade O
regulations O
, O
including O
the O
new O
vice-admiralty B-Organization
court I-Organization
in O
Halifax B-Location

Nova B-Location
Scotia I-Location
( O
hence O
the O
reference O
to O
Halifax B-Location
in O
the O
title O
of O
the O
pamphlet O
) O
. O

Frustrated O
with O
the O
popular O
and O
faction-ridden O
politics O
of O
Rhode B-Organization
Island I-Organization
, O
they O
wanted O
nothing O
less O
than O
the O
revocation O
of O
Rhode B-Organization
Island I-Organization
’ O
s O
charter O
and O
the O
royalization O
of O
this O
excessively O
democratic O
colony B-Organization
. O

Howard B-Person
’ O
s O
attempt O
to O
rest O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
on O
the O
common O
law O
was O
not O
all O
that O
different O
from O
Otis B-Person
’ O
s O
argument O
in O
his O
Rights O
of O
the O
British B-Organization
Colonies I-Organization
. O

But O
the O
emerging O
idea O
of O
parliamentary O
sovereignty—that O
parliamentary O
statutes O
as O
acts O
of O
legislative O
will O
trump O
the O
traditional O
rules O
of O
the O
common O
law—made O
Howard B-Person
’ O
s O
position O
as O
soft O
and O
fluid O
as O
Otis B-Person
’ O
s O
. O

And O
Howard B-Person
’ O
s O
contention O
that O
the O
corporate O
charter O
of O
Rhode B-Organization
Island I-Organization
was O
merely O
a O
gift O
of O
the O
Crown B-Organization
and O
that O
the O
colonists O
had O
no O
rights O
independent O
of O
their O
charters O
was O
bound O
to O
raise O
fear O
and O
anger O
among O
Rhode O
Islanders O
. O

In O
August O
1765 O
, O
before O
the O
Stamp O
Act O
could O
be O
enforced O
, O
rioting O
erupted O
up O
and O
down O
the O
continent B-Location

Mobs O
in O
every O
colony O
save O
Georgia B-Location
, O
where O
a O
few O
stamps O
were O
briefly O
distributed O
, O
forced O
the O
newly O
appointed O
stamp O
agents O
to O
resign O
, O
effectively O
nullifying O
the O
law O
. O

On O
August O
27 O
, O
1765 O
, O
a O
crowd O
of O
protestors O
in O
Newport B-Location
carried O
through O
the O
streets O
effigies O
of O
Howard B-Person
and O
several O
other O
Newport O
royalists O
, O
including O
the O
stamp O
agent O
, O
later O
suspending O
the O
crude O
figures O
from O
gallows O
erected O
in O
front O
of O
the O
courthouse O
and O
eventually O
burning O
them O
. O

When O
on O
the O
following O
night O
his O
house O
was O
gutted O
by O
another O
mob O

MY O
DEAR O
SIR O
, O
I O
THANK O
you O
very O
kindly O
for O
the O
pamphlets O
and O
news-papers O
, O
you O
was O
so O
obliging O
as O
to O
send O
me O
. O

I O
will O
, O
according O
to O
your O
request O
, O
give O
you O
a O
few O
miscellaneous O
strictures O
on O
that O
pamplet O
wrote O
by O
Mr B-Person
. I-Person
H—p—s I-Person
, O
your O
governor O
, O
entitled O
, O
“ O
The O
rights O
of O
colonies B-Organization
examined O
. O
” O

His O
honour B-Person
reminds O
me O
of O
the O
Roman B-Organization
poet I-Organization
. O

“ O
Est O
genus O
hominum O
, O
qui O
esse O
primos O
se O
omnium O
rerum O
volunt O
, O
Nec O
sunt O
. O
— O
— O
” O
He O
seems O
to O
give O
a O
solemnity O
to O
his O
performance O
, O
as O
if O
the O
subject O
had O
not O
been O
sufficiently O
handled O
by O
any O
other O
before O
him O
, O
but O
I O
am O
of O
opinion O
he O
falls O
very O
short O
of O
Mr B-Person
. I-Person
— I-Person
— I-Person
, O
who O
, O
though O
unhappily O
misled O
by O
popular O
ideas O
, O
and O
at O
the O
head O
of O
the O
tribunitian O
veto O
, O
yet O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
man O
of O
knowledge O
and O
parts O
: O
Whereas O
the O
rights O
of O
colonies O
examined O
, O
is O
a O
laboured O
, O
ostentatious O
piece O
, O
discovers O
its O
author O
to O
be O
totally O
unacquainted O
with O
stile O
or O
diction O
, O
and O
eagerly O
fond O
to O
pass O
upon O
the O
world O
for O
a O
man O
of O
letters O
. O

I O
cannot O
forgive O
the O
honourable O
author O
in O
adopting O
for O
his O
motto O
the O
three O
lines O
from O
Thompson B-Person
, O
so O
little O
applicable O
are O
they O
to O
the O
present O
times O
. O

I O
might O
challenge O
all O
the O
sons O
of O
discontent O
and O
faction O
, O
in O
the O
British B-Location
dominions I-Location
, O
to O
shew O
the O
least O
similitude O
between O
the O
years O
one O
thousand O
six O
hundred O
and O
forty-one O
, O
and O
one O
thousand O
seven O
hundred O
and O
sixty-four O
. O

How O
cruel O
and O
invidious O
is O
it O
to O
insinuate O
the O
most O
distant O
likeness O
between O
the O
two O
periods O
? O

How O
much O
like O
sedition O
does O
it O
seem O
, O
to O
associate O
the O
present O
transactions O
of O
the O
nation B-Organization
with O
those O
of O
one O
thousand O
six O
hundred O
and O
forty-one O
, O
which O
soon O
after O
kindled O
into O
a O
civil O
war O
, O
and O
in O
the O
end O
overturned O
the O
English O
constitution O
? O

The O
honourable O
author B-Person
might O
perhaps O
flatter O
himself O
, O
that O
, O
in O
future O
editions O
of O
Thompson B-Person
’ O
s O
liberty O
, O
commentators O
may O
insert O
variæ O
lectiones O
of O
the O
text O
, O
and O
the O
three O
lines O
run O
thus O
: O
“ O
Mid O
the O
low O
murmurs O
of O
submissive O
fear O
, O
And O
mingled O
rage O
, O

H—p—s B-Person
rais O
’ O
d O
his O
voice O
, O
And O
to O
the O
laws O
appeal O

” O

Or O
perhaps O
some O
future O
bard O
may O
sing O
the O
present O
times O
, O
and O
HE O
be O
made O
the O
hero O
of O
the O
song O
. O

The O
aptness O
is O
easy O
and O
striking O
, O
and O
the O
idea O
too O
pleasing O
to O
be O
resisted O
. O

Narcissus B-Location

in O
contemplating O
his O
own O
image O
, O
was O
turned O
into O

can O
think O

this O

and O
feel O
no O
pity O
for O
the O
pride O
and O
weakness O
of O

I O
would O
fain O
hope O
that O
his O
honour B-Person
’ O
s O
motto O
is O
not O
a O
true O
portrait O
of O
the O
general O
temper O
and O
conduct O
of O
the O

; O
I O
would O
rather O
think O
“ O
the O

rage O
, O
” O
delineate O
only O
a O

It O
were O
to O

wished O
that O
some O

endeavour O
to O
remove O
any O
unfavourable O

of O
the O
like O
kind O
, O
may O
have O
occasioned O
at O

lest O
those O
in O
power O
form O
the O
general O
character O
of O
the O

from O
such O
notices O
as O
these O
convey O

from O

to O
increase O
their O
dependance O

rather O
than O
to O
emancipate O

Depend O
upon O
it O
, O
my O
Friend O

a O
people O
like O
the O
English O
, O
arrived O
to O
the O
highest O
pitch O
of O

, O
the O
envy O

admiration O
of O
surrounding O

who O
hold O
the O
balance O
of O

in O
their O

and O
rival O
in O

period O
of O

; O
a O
nation B-Organization
who O
, O
for O
the O
defence O
and O
safety O
of O

only O
, O
staked O
their O
all O
in O

late O

this O
people O
, O
I O
say O
, O
justly O
conscious O
of O
their O
dignity O

will O
not O
patiently O
be O
dictated O
to O

those O

Happy O
will O
it O
be O
for O

yea O
happy O
for O
the O
honourable O
author B-Person
, O
if O
his O

should O
meet O
with O
nothing O
more O
than O
contempt O
and O
neglect O
; O
for O
should O
it O
catch O
the O
attention O
of O

be O
taken O
to O
stifle O
in O

“ O

” O
and O
crush O
in O

“ O

which O
now O
so O
prettily O
adorns O

head O

. O

However O
disguised O
, O
polished O
or O
softened O
the O
expression O
of O
this O
pamphlet O
may O
seem O
, O
yet O
every O
one O
must O
see O
, O
that O
its O
professed O
design O
is O
sufficiently O
prominent O
throughout O
, O
namely O
, O
to O
prove O
, O
that O
the O
colonies B-Organization
have O
rights O
independant O
of O
, O
and O
not O
controulable O
by O
, O
the O
authority O
of O
parliament B-Organization
. O

It O
is O
upon O
this O
dangerous O
and O
indiscreet O
position O
I O
shall O
communicate O
to O
you O
my O
real O
sentiments O
. O

To O
suppose O
a O
design O
of O
enslaving O
the O
colonies B-Organization
by O
parliament B-Organization
, O
is O
too O
presumptuous O
; O
to O
propagate O
it O
in O
print O
, O
is O
perhaps O
dangerous O
. O

Perplexed O
between O
a O
desire O
of O
speaking O
all O
he O
thinks O
, O
and O
the O
fear O
of O
saying O
too O
much O
, O
the O
honourable O
author B-Person
is O
obliged O
to O
entrench O
himself O
in O
obscurity O
and O
inconsistency O
in O
several O
parts O
of O
his O
performance O
: O
I O
shall O
bring O
one O
instance O
. O

In O
page O
131 O
, O
he O
says O
, O
“ O
It O
is O
the O
indispensible O
duty O
of O
every O
good O
and O
loyal O
subject O
chearfully O
to O

and O
patiently O

. O
that O
may O
be O
passed O
by O

” O

I O
do O
not O
much O
admire O
either O
the O
spirit O
or O
composition O
of O
this O
sentence O
. O

Is O
it O
the O
duty O
only O
of O
good O
and O
loyal O
subjects O
to O
obey O
? O

Are O
the O
wicked O
and O
disloyal O
subjects O
absolved O
from O
this O
obligation O
? O

else O
why O
is O
this O
passage O
so O
marvellously O
penned O
: O
Philoleutherus B-Person
Lipsiensis I-Person
would O
directly O
pronounce O
this O
a O
figure O
in O
rhetorick O
, O
called O
nonsense O
. O

— O
Believe O
me O
, O
my O
friend O
, O
I O
did O
not O
quote O
this O
passage O
to O
shew O
my O
skill O
in O
criticism O
, O
but O
to O
point O
out O
a O
contradiction O
between O
it O
, O
and O
another O
passage O
in O
page O
138 O
, O
which O
runs O
thus O
: O
“ O
It O
must O
be O
absurd O
to O
suppose O
, O
that O
the O
common O
people O
of O
Great-Britain B-Location
have O
a O
sovereign O
and O
absolute O
authority O
over O
their O
fellow O
subjects O
of O
America B-Location
, O
or O
even O
any O
sort O
of O
power O
whatsoever O
over O
them O
; O
but O
it O
will O
be O
still O
more O
absurd O
to O
suppose O
, O
they O
can O
give O
a O
power O
to O
their O
representatives O
, O
which O
they O
have O
not O
themselves O
, O
” O
& O
c O
. O

Here O
it O
is O
observable O
, O
that O
the O
first O
cited O
passage O
expresses O
a O
full O
submission O
to O
the O
authority O
of O
parliament B-Organization
; O
the O
last O
is O
as O
explicit O
a O
denial O
of O
that O
authority O
. O

The O
sum O
of O
his O
honour B-Person
’ O
s O
argument O
is O
this O
: O
The O
people O
of O
Great-Britain B-Location
have O
not O
any O
sort O
of O
power O
over O
the O
Americans O
; O
the O
house B-Organization
of I-Organization
commons I-Organization
have O
no O
greater O
authority O
than O
the O
people O
of O
Great-Britain B-Location
, O
who O
are O
their O
constituents O
; O
ergo O
, O
the O
house B-Organization
of I-Organization
commons I-Organization
have O
not O
any O
sort O
of O
power O
over O
the O
Americans O
. O

This O
is O
indeed O
a O
curious O
invented O
syllogism O
, O
the O
sole O
merit O
of O
which O
is O
due O
to O
the O
first O
magistrate O
of O
an O
English O
colony O
. O

I O
have O
endeavoured O
to O
investigate O
the O
true O
natural O
relation O
, O
if O
I O
may O
so O
speak O
, O
between O
colonies B-Organization
and O
their O
mother B-Organization
state I-Organization
, I-Organization
abstracted O
from O
compact O
or O
positive O
institution O
, O
but O
here O
I O
can O
find O
nothing O
satisfactory O
; O
till O
this O
relation O
is O
clearly O
defined O
upon O
a O
rational O
and O
natural O
principle O
, O
our O
reasoning O
upon O
the O
measure O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
obedience O
will O
be O
desultory O
and O
inconclusive O
. O

Every O
connection O
in O
life O
has O
its O
reciprocal O
duties O
; O
we O
know O
the O
relation O
between O
a O
parent O
and O
child O
, O
husband O
and O
wife O
, O
master O
and O
servant O
, O
and O
from O
thence O
are O
able O
to O
deduce O
their O
respective O
obligations O
; O
but O
we O
have O
no O
notices O
of O
any O
such O
precise O
natural O
relation O
between O
a O
mother O
state O
and O
its O
colonies O
, O
and O
therefore O
cannot O
reason O
with O
so O
much O
certainty O
upon O
the O
power O
of O
the O
one O
, O
or O
the O
duty O
of O
the O
others O
. O

The O
ancients O
have O
transmitted O
to O
us O
nothing O
that O
is O
applicable O
to O
the O
state O
of O
modern O
colonies O
, O
because O
the O
relation O
between O
these O
is O
formed O
by O
political O
compact O
; O
and O
the O
condition O
of O
each O
variant O
in O
their O
original O
, O
and O
from O
each O
other O
. O

The O
honourable O
author B-Person
has O
not O
freed O
this O
subject O
from O
any O
of O
its O
embarrassments O
: O
Vague O
and O
diffuse O
talk O
of O
rights O
and O

changes O

the O
words O

only O
serve O
to O
convince O
us O
, O
that O
words O
may O
affect O
without O
raising O
images O
, O
or O
affording O
any O
repose O
to O
a O
mind O
philosophically O
inquisitive O
. O

For O
my O
own O
part O
, O
I O
will O
shun O
the O
walk O
of O
metaphysicks O
in O
my O
enquiry O
, O
and O
be O
content O
to O
consider O
the O
colonies B-Location
rights O
upon O
the O
footing O
of O
their O
charters O
, O
which O
are O
the O
only O
plain O
avenues O
, O
that O
lead O
to O
the O
truth O
of O
this O
matter O
. O

The O
several O
New-England O
charters O
ascertain O
, O
define O
and O
limit O
the O
respective O
rights O
and O
privileges O
of O
each O
colony O
, O
and O
I O
cannot O
conceive O
how O
it O
has O
come O
to O
pass O
that O
the O
colonies B-Organization
now O
claim O
any O
other O
or O
greater O
rights O
than O
are O
therein O
expresly O
granted O
to O
them O
. O

I O
fancy O
when O
we O
speak O
, O
or O
think O
of O
the O
rights O
of O
free-born O
Englishmen O
, O
we O
confound O
those O
rights O
which O
are O
personal O
, O
with O
those O
which O
are O
political O
: O
There O
is O
a O
distinction O
between O
these O
, O
which O
ought O
always O
to O
be O
kept O
in O
view O
. O

Our O
personal O
rights O
, O
comprehending O
those O
of O
life O
, O
liberty O
and O
estate O
, O
are O
secured O
to O
us O
by O
the O
common O
law O
, O
which O
is O
every O
subject O
’ O
s O
birthright O
, O
whether O
born O
in O
Great-Britain B-Location
, O
on O
the O
ocean B-Location
, O
or O
in O
the O
colonies B-Location
; O
and O
it O
is O
in O
this O
sense O
we O
are O
said O
to O
enjoy O
all O
the O
rights O
and O
privileges O
of O
Englishmen O
. O

The O
political O
rights O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
or O
the O
powers O
of O
government O
communicated O
to O
them O
, O
are O
more O
limited O
, O
and O
their O
nature O
, O
quality O
and O
extent O
depend O
altogether O
upon O
the O
patent O
or O
charter O
which O
first O
created O
and O
instituted O
them O
. O

As O
individuals O
, O
the O
colonists O
participate O
of O
every O
blessing O
the O
English O
constitution O
can O
give O
them O
: O
As O
corporations O
created O
by O
the O
crown B-Organization
, O
they O
are O
confined O
within O
the O
primitive O
views O
of O
their O
institution O
. O

Whether O
therefore O
their O
indulgence O
is O
scanty O
or O
liberal O
, O
can O
be O
no O
cause O
of O
complaint O
; O
for O
when O
they O
accepted O
of O
their O
charters O
, O
they O
tacitly O
submitted O
to O
the O
terms O
and O
conditions O
of O
them O
. O

The O
colonies B-Organization
have O
no O
rights O
independant O
of O
their O
charters O
, O
they O
can O
claim O
no O
greater O
than O
those O
give O
them O
, O
by O
those O
the O
parliamentary O
jurisdiction O
over O
them O
is O
not O
taken O
away O
, O
neither O
could O
any O
grant O
of O
the O
king B-Organization
abridge O
that O
jurisdiction O
, O
because O
it O
is O
founded O
upon O
common O
law O
, O
as O
I O
shall O
presently O
shew O
, O
and O
was O
prior O
to O
any O
charter O
or O
grant O
to O
the O
colonies B-Organization
: O
Every O
Englishman O
, O
therefore O
, O
is O
subject O
to O
this O
jurisdiction O
, O
and O
it O
follows O
him O
wherever O
he O
goes O
. O

It O
is O
of O
the O
essence O
of O
government O
, O
that O
there O
should O
be O
a O
supreme O
head O
, O
and O
it O
would O
be O
a O
solecism O
in O
politicks O
to O
talk O
of O
members O
independant O
of O
it O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
parliament B-Organization
, O
I O
shall O
endeavour O
to O
shew O
, O
that O
it O
is O
attached O
to O
every O
English O
subject O
, O
wherever O
he O
be O
: O
And O
I O
am O
led O
to O
do O
this O
from O
a O
clause O
in O
page O
129 O
of O
his O
honour B-Person
’ O
s O
pamphlet O
, O
where O
he O
says O
, O
“ O
That O
the O
colonies B-Organization
do O
not O
hold O
their O
rights O
, O
as O
a O
privilege O
granted O
them O
, O
nor O
enjoy O
them O
as O
a O
grace O
and O
favour O
bestowed O
; O
but O
possess O
them O
, O
as O
an O
inherent O
, O
indefeasible O
right O
. O
” O

This O
postulatum O
cannot O
be O
true O
with O
regard O
to O
political O
rights O
, O
for O
I O
have O
already O
shewn O
, O
that O
these O
are O
derived O
from O
your O
charters O
, O
and O
are O
held O
by O
force O
of O
the O
king B-Organization
’ O
s O
grant O
; O
therefore O
these O
inherent O
, O
indefeasible O
rights O
, O
as O
his O
honour B-Person
calls O
them O
, O
must O
be O
personal O
ones O
, O
according O
to O
the O
distinction O
already O
made O
. O

Permit O
me O
to O
say O
, O
that O
inherent O
and O
indefeasible O
as O
these O
rights O
may O
be O
, O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
parliament B-Organization
, O
over O
every O
English O
subject O
, O
is O
equally O
as O
inherent O
and O
indefeasible O
: O
That O
both O
have O
grown O
out O
of O
the O
same O
stock O
, O
and O
that O
if O
we O
avail O
ourselves O
of O
the O
one O
, O
we O
must O
submit O
to O
, O
and O
acknowlege O
the O
other O
. O

It O
might O
here O
be O
properly O
enough O
asked O
, O
Are O
these O
personal O
rights O
selfexistent O
? O

Have O
they O
no O
original O
source O
? O

I O
answer O
, O
They O
are O
derived O
from O
the O
constitution O
of O
England B-Organization
, O
which O
is O
the O
common O
law O
; O
and O
from O
the O
same O
fountain O
is O
also O
derived O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
parliament B-Organization
over O
us O
. O

But O
to O
bring O
this O
argument O
down O
to O
the O
most O
vulgar O
apprehension O
: O
The O
common O
law O
has O
established O
it O
as O
a O
rule O
or O
maxim O
, O
that O
the O
plantations B-Organization
are O
bound O
by O
British O
acts O
of O
parliament B-Organization
, O
if O
particularly O
named O
: O
And O
surely O
no O
Englishman O
, O
in O
his O
senses O
, O
will O
deny O
the O
force O
of O
a O
common O
law O
maxim O
. O

One O
cannot O
but O
smile O
at O
the O
inconsistency O
of O
these O
inherent O
, O
indefeasible O
men O
: O
If O
one O
of O
them O
has O
a O
suit O
at O
law O
, O
in O
any O
part O
of O
New-England B-Location
, O
upon O
a O
question O
of O
land O
property O
, O
or O
merchandize O
, O
he O
appeals O
to O
the O
common O
law O
, O
to O
support O
his O
claim O
, O
or O
defeat O
his O
adversary O
; O
and O
yet O
is O
so O
profoundly O
stupid O
as O
to O
say O
, O
that O
an O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
does O
not O
bind O
him O
; O
when O
, O
perhaps O
, O
the O
same O
page O
in O
a O
law O
book O
, O
which O
points O
him O
out O
a O
remedy O
for O
a O
libel O
, O
or O
a O
slap O
in O
the O
face O
, O
would O
inform O
him O
that O
it O
does O
. O

— O
In O
a O
word O
, O
The O
force O
of O
an O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
, O
over O
the O
colonies B-Location
, O
is O
predicated O
upon O
the O
common O
law O
, O
the O
origin O
and O
basis O
of O
all O
those O
inherent O
rights O
and O
privileges O
which O
constitute O
the O
boast O
and O
felicity O
of O
a O
Briton O
. O

Can O
we O
claim O
the O
common O
law O
as O
an O
inheritance O
, O
and O
at O
the O
same O
time O
be O
at O
liberty O
to O
adopt O
one O
part O
of O
it O
, O
and O
reject O
the O
other O
? O

Indeed O
we O
cannot O
: O
The O
common O
law O
, O
pure O
and O
indivisible O
in O
its O
nature O
and O
essence O
, O
cleaves O
to O
us O
during O
our O
lives O
, O
and O
follows O
us O
from O
Nova B-Location
Zembla I-Location
to O
Cape B-Location
Horn I-Location
; O
And O
therefore O
, O
as O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
parliament B-Organization
arises O
out O
of O
, O
and O
is O
supported O
by O
it O
, O
we O
may O
as O
well O
renounce O
our O
allegiance O
, O
or O
change O
our O
nature O
, O
as O
to O
be O
exempt O
from O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
parliament B-Organization
: O
Hence O
, O
it O
is O
plain O
to O
me O
, O
that O
in O
denying O
this O
jurisdiction O
, O
we O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
take O
leave O
of O
the O
common O
law O
, O
and O
thereby O
, O
with O
equal O
temerity O
and O
folly O
, O
strip O
ourselves O
of O
every O
blessing O
we O
enjoy O
as O
Englishmen O
: O
A O
flagrant O
proof O
this O
, O
that O
shallow O
draughts O
in O
politicks O
and O
legislation O
confound O
and O
distract O
us O
, O
and O
that O
an O
extravagant O
zeal O
often O
defeats O
its O
own O
purposes O
. O

I O
am O
aware O
that O
the O
foregoing O
reasoning O
will O
be O
opposed O
by O
the O
maxim O
, O
“ O
That O
no O
Englishman O
can O
be O
taxed O
but O
by O
his O
own O
consent O
, O
or O
by O
representatives B-Organization
. O
” O

It O
is O
this O
dry O
maxim O
, O
taken O
in O
a O
literal O
sense O
, O
and O
ill O
understood O
, O
that O
, O
like O
the O
song O
of O
Lillibullero O
, O
has O
made O
all O
the O
mischief O
in O
the O
colonies B-Location
: O
And O
upon O
this O
, O
the O
partizans O
of O
the O
colonies B-Location
rights O
chiefly O
rest O
their O
cause O
. O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
despair O
, O
however O
, O
of O
convincing O
you O
, O
that O
this O
maxim O
affords O
but O
little O
support O
to O
their O
argument O
, O
when O
rightly O
examined O
and O
explained O
. O

It O
is O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
house B-Organization
of I-Organization
commons I-Organization
, O
and O
may O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
law O
of O
parliament B-Organization
, O
that O
they O
are O
the O
representatives O
of O
every O
British O
subject O
, O
wheresoever O
he O
be O
. O

In O
this O
view O
of O
the O
matter O
then O
, O
the O
aforegoing O
maxim O
is O
fully O
vindicated O
in O
practice O
, O
and O
the O
whole O
benefit O
of O
it O
, O
in O
substance O
and O
effect O
, O
extended O
and O
applied O
to O
the O
colonies B-Organization
. O

Indeed O
the O
maxim O
must O
be O
considered O
in O
this O
latitude O
, O
for O
in O
a O
literal O
sense O
or O
construction O
it O
ever O
was O
, O
and O
ever O
will O
be O
, O
impracticable O
. O

Let O
me O
ask O
, O
is O
the O
isle B-Location
of I-Location
Man I-Location
, O
Jersey B-Location
, O
or O
Guernsey B-Location
, O
represented O
? O

What O
is O
the O
value O
or O
amount O
of O
each O
man O
’ O
s O
representation O
in O
the O
kingdom B-Location
of I-Location
Scotland I-Location
, O
which O
contains O
near O
two O
millions O
of O
people O
, O
and O
yet O
not O
more O
than O
three O
thousand O
have O
votes O
in O
the O
election O
of O
members O
of O
parliament B-Organization
? O

But O
to O
shew O
still O
further O
, O
that O
, O
in O
fact O
and O
reality O
, O
this O
right O
of O
representation O
is O
not O
of O
that O
consequence O
it O
is O
generally O
thought O
to O
be O
, O
let O
us O
take O
into O
the O
argument O
the O
moneyed O
interest O
of O
Britain B-Organization
, O
which O
, O
though O
immensely O
great O
, O
has O
no O
share O
in O
this O
representation O
; O
a O
worthless O
freeholder O
of O
forty O
shillings O
per O
annum O
can O
vote O
for O
a O
member O
of O
parliament B-Organization
, O
whereas O
a O
merchant O
, O
tho O
’ O
worth O
one O
hundred O
thousand O
pounds O
sterling O
, O
if O
it O
consist O
only O
in O
personal O
effects O
, O
has O
no O
vote O
at O
all O
: O
But O
yet O
let O
no O
one O
suppose O
that O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
latter O
is O
not O
equally O
the O
object O
of O
parliamentary O
attention O
with O
the O
former O
. O

— O
Let O
me O
add O
one O
example O
more O
: O
Copyholders O
in O
England B-Location
of O
one O
thousand O
pounds O
sterling O
per O
annum O
, O
whose O
estates O
in O
land O
are O
nominally O
, O
but O
not O
intrinsically O
, O
inferior O
to O
a O
freehold O
, O
cannot O
, O
by O
law O
, O
vote O
for O
members O
of O
parliament B-Organization
; O
yet O
we O
never O
hear O
that O
these O
people O
“ O
murmur O
with O
submissive O
fear O
, O
and O
mingled O
rage O
: O
” O
They O
don O
’ O
t O
set O
up O
their O
private O
humour O
against O
the O
constitution O
of O
their O
country B-Organization
, O
but O
submit O
with O
chearfulness O
to O
those O
forms O
of O
government O
which O
providence O
, O
in O
its O
goodness O
, O
has O
placed O
them O
under O
. O

Suppose O
that O
this O
Utopian O
privilege O
of O
representation O
should O
take O
place O
, O
I O
question O
if O
it O
would O
answer O
any O
other O
purpose O
but O
to O
bring O
an O
expence O
upon O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
unless O
you O
can O
suppose O
that O
a O
few O
American O
members O
could O
bias O
the O
deliberations O
of O
the O
whole O
British B-Organization
legislature I-Organization
. O

In O
short O
, O
this O
right O
of O
representation O
is O
but O
a O
phantom O
, O
and O
, O
if O
possessed O
in O
its O
full O
extent O
, O
would O
be O
of O
no O
real O
advantage O
to O
the O
colonies B-Organization
; O
they O
would O
, O
like O
Ixion B-Person
, O
embrace O
a O
cloud O
in O
the O
shape O
of O
Juno B-Person
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
head O
, O
I O
could O
further O
urge O
the O
danger O
of O
innovations O
; O
every O
change O
in O
a O
constitution O
, O
in O
some O
degree O
, O
weakens O
its O
original O
frame O
; O
and O
hence O
it O
is O
that O
legislators O
and O
statesmen O
are O
cautious O
in O
admitting O
them O
: O
The O
goodly O
building O
of O
the O
British O
constitution O
will O
be O
best O
secured O
and O
perpetuated O
by O
adhering O
to O
its O
original O
principles O
. O

Parliaments O
are O
not O
of O
yesterday O
, O
they O
are O
as O
antient O
as O
our O
Saxon O
ancestors O
. O

Attendance O
in O
parliament B-Organization
was O
originally O
a O
duty O
arising O
from O
a O
tenure O
of O
lands O
, O
and O
grew O
out O
of O
the O
feudal O
system O
; O
so O
that O
the O
privilege O
of O
sitting O
in O
it O
, O
is O
territorial O
, O
and O
confined O
to O
Britain B-Location
only O
. O

Why O
should O
the O
beauty O
and O
symmetry O
of O
this O
body O
be O
destroyed O
, O
and O
its O
purity O
defiled O
, O
by O
the O
unnatural O
mixture O
of O
representatives O
from O
every O
part O
of O
the O
British B-Location
dominions I-Location
? O

Parthians O
, O
Medes O
, O
Elamites O

and O
the O
dwellers O
of O
Mesopotamia B-Location

would O
not O

in O
such O
a O
case O

speak O
the O

What O
a O
heterogeneous O
council O
would O
this O
form O

what O
a O

— O
In O
truth O
, O
my O
friend O
, O
the O
matter O
lies O
here O
: O
The O
freedom O
and O
happiness O
of O
every O
British O
subject O
depends O
, O
not O
upon O
his O
share O
in O
elections O
, O
but O
upon O
the O
sense O
and O
virtue O
of O
the O
British B-Organization
parliament I-Organization
, O
and O
these O
depend O
reciprocally O
upon O
the O
sense O
and O
virtue O
of O
the O
whole O
nation B-Organization

When O
virtue O
and O
honour B-Person

no O

the O
lovely O

follow O
, O
that O
this O

be O
apportioned O

it O
is O
transcendant O

entire O

there O
is O
no O

A O

confessedly O
the O
most O
reasonable O
and O
equitable O
that O
can O
be O

, O
yet O
very O
far O
am O
I O
from O
desiring O
to O

it O

but O
I O
fear O
the O
shaft O
is O
sped O

and O
it O
is O
now O
too O
late O
to O

the O

The O
examples O
cited O
by O
his O
honour B-Person
, O
with O
regard O
to O
ancient O
colonies O
, O
may O
shew O
his O
reading O
and O
erudition O
, O
but O
are O
of O
no O
authority O
in O
the O
present O
question O
. O

I O
am O
not O
enough O
skilled O
in O
the O
Grecian O
history O
to O
correct O
the O
proofs O
drawn O
from O
thence O
, O
though O
they O
amount O
to O
very O
little O
. O

If O
the O
Grecian B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
, O
as O
his O
honour B-Person
says O
, O
“ O
took O
such O
forms O
of O
government O
as O
themselves O
chose O
, O
” O
there O
is O
no O
kind O
of O
similitude O
between O
them O
and O
the O
English B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
, O
and O
therefore O
to O
name O
them O
is O
nothing O
to O
the O
purpose O
. O

The O
English B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
take O
their O
forms O
of O
government O
from O
the O
crown B-Organization
; O
hold O
their O
privileges O
upon O
condition O
, O
that O
they O
do O
not O
abuse O
them O
; O
and O
hold O
their O
lands O
by O
the O
tenure O
of O
common O
socage O
, O
which O
involves O
in O
it O
fealty O
and O
obedience O
to O
the O
king B-Organization
: O
Hence O
it O
is O
plain O
, O
his O
honour B-Person
’ O
s O
argument O
is O
not O
strengthened O
by O
the O
example O
of O
the O
Grecian B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
; O
for O
what O
likeness O
is O
there O
between O
independant O
colonies O
, O
as O
those O
must O
be O
, O
which O
“ O
took O
such O
forms O
of O
government O
as O
themselves O
chose O
, O
” O
and O
colonies O
like O
ours O
, O
which O
are O
in O
a O
manner O
feudatory O
, O
and O
holden O
of O
a O
superior O
. O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
Roman B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
, O
I O
must O
beg O
leave O
to O
say O
, O
that O
the O
honourable O
author B-Person
, O
either O
ignorantly O
or O
wilfully O
, O
mistakes O
the O
facts O
: O
A O
little O
more O
enquiry O
, O
or O
a O
little O
more O
candour O
, O
would O
have O
convinced O
him O
, O
that O
the O
Roman B-Organization
coloniæ I-Organization
did O
not O
enjoy O
all O
the O
rights O
of O
Roman O
citizens O
; O
on O
the O
contrary O
, O
they O
only O
used O
the O
Roman O
laws O
and O
religion O
, O
and O
served O
in O
the O
legions O
, O
but O
had O
not O
the O
right O
of O
suffrage O
, O
or O
of O
bearing O
honours O
. O

In O
these O
respects O
, O
our O
English B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
exactly O
resemble O
them O
; O
we O
enjoy O
the O
English O
laws O
and O
religion O
, O
but O
have O
not O
the O
right O
of O
suffrage O
, O
or O
of O
bearing O
honours O
in O
Great-Britain O
, O
and O
indeed O
our O
situation O
renders O
it O
impossible O
. O

If O
the O
practice O
of O
the O
ancients O
was O
of O
any O
authority O
in O
this O
case O
, O
I O
could O
name O
examples O
to O
justify O
the O
enslaving O
of O
colonies O
. O

The O
Carthaginians O
were O
a O
free O
people O
, O
yet O
they O
, O
to O
render O
the O
Sardinians O
and O
Corsicans O
more O
dependant O
, O
forbad O
their O
planting O
, O
sowing O
, O
or O
doing O
any O
thing O
of O
the O
like O
kind O
, O
under O
pain O
of O
death O
, O
so O
that O
they O
supplied O
them O
with O
necessaries O
from O
Africa B-Location
: O
This O
was O
indeed O
very O
hard O
. O

But O
there O
is O
something O
extremely O
weak O
and O
inconclusive O
in O
recurring O
to O
the O
Grecian O
and O
Roman O
history O
for O
examples O
to O
illustrate O
any O
particular O
favourite O
opinion O
: O
If O
a O
deference O
to O
the O
ancients O
should O
direct O
the O
practice O
of O
the O
moderns O
, O
we O
might O
sell O
our O
children O
to O
pay O
our O
debts O
, O
and O
justify O
it O
by O
the O
practice O
of O
the O
Athenians O
. O

We O
might O
lend O
our O
wives O
to O
our O
friends O
, O
and O
justify O
it O
from O
the O
Example O
of O
Cato B-Person
, O
among O
the O
Romans O
. O

In O
a O
word O
, O
my O
dear O
Sir O
, O
the O
belly O
of O
a O
sow O
, O
pickled O
, O
was O
a O
high O
dish O
in O
ancient B-Organization
Rome I-Organization
; O
and O
I O
imagine O
, O
as O
you O
advance O
in O
the O
refinements O
of O
luxury O
, O
this O
will O
become O
a O
capital O
part O
of O
a O
Rhode-Island O
feast O
, O
so O
fond O
you O
seem O
of O
ancient O
customs O
and O
laws O
. O

Instead O
of O
wandring O
in O
the O
labyrinth O
of O
ancient O
colonies O
, O
I O
would O
advise O
his O
honour B-Person
to O
read O
the O
debates O
in O
parliament B-Organization
in O
the O
year O
one O
thousand O
seven O
hundred O
and O
thirty-three O
, O
when O
Mr B-Person
. I-Person
Partridge I-Person
, O
your O
agent O
, O
petitioned O
the O
commons B-Organization
against O
the O
then O
sugar-bill O
; O
he O
will O
there O
find O
more O
satisfaction O
upon O
the O
subject O
of O
colonies B-Organization
, O
than O
in O
Thucydides B-Person
’ O
s O
history O
of O
the O
Pelopennesian O
war O
. O

It O
was O
declared O
in O
the O
course O
of O
that O
debate O
, O
that O
the O
colonists O
were O
a O
part O
of O
the O
people O
of O
Great-Britain B-Organization
; O
and O
, O
as O
such O
, O
fully O
represented O
in O
that O
house B-Organization
. O

The O
petition O
then O
presented O
by O
Mr B-Person
. I-Person
Partridge I-Person
, O
was O
of O
a O
very O
different O
temper O
from O
those O
now O
sent O
home O
by O
the O
colonies B-Organization
; O
it O
was O
extremely O
modest O
, O
and O
only O
intimated O
that O
the O
sugar O
bill O
, O
if O
passed O
into O
a O
law O
, O
might O
be O
prejudicial O
to O
their O
charter O
; O
at O
the O
bare O
mention O
of O
this O
Sir B-Person
William I-Person
Yonge I-Person
took O
fire O
, O
and O
said O
, O
“ O
It O
looked O
like O
aiming O
at O
an O
independency O
, O
and O
disclaiming O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
that O
house B-Organization
, O
as O
if O
( O
says O
he O
) O
this O
house B-Organization
had O
not O
a O
power O
to O
tax O
the O
colonies B-Location
. O
” O

Mr B-Person
. I-Person
Winnington I-Person
, O
with O
equal O
warmth O
, O
added O
, O
“ O
I O
hope O
they O
have O
no O
charter O
which O
debars O
this O
house O
from O
taxing O
them O
, O
as O
well O
as O
any O
other O
subject O
of O
the O
nation B-Organization
. O
” O

Here O
you O
have O
the O
opinion O
of O
two O
of O
the O
most O
eminent O
members O
of O
that O
time O
; O
they O
spoke O
the O
sentiments O
of O
the O
whole O
house B-Organization
, O
and O
these O
sentiments O
still O
continue O
the O
same O
. O

And O
from O
hence O
you O
may O
perceive O
, O
how O
little O
prospect O
there O
is O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
gaining O
any O
point O
upon O
the O
footing O
of O
these O
new O
supposititious O
rights O
; O
broaching O
such O
opinions O
will O
excite O
the O
jealousy O
of O
the O
parliament B-Organization
, O
and O
you O
will O
be O
looked O
upon O
with O
an O
evil O
eye O
. O

The O
promoters O
of O
such O
doctrines O
are O
no O
friends O
to O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
whatever O
may O
be O
their O
pretensions O
. O

Can O
his O
honour B-Person
be O
so O
vain O
as O
to O
imagine O
, O
that O
ten O
thousand O
such O
pamphlets O
as O
his O
, O
will O
influence O
the O
parliament B-Organization
, O
or O
that O
they O
will O
be O
persuaded O
, O
by O
the O
force O
of O
his O
elocution O
, O
to O
give O
up O
their O
supremacy O
, O
and O
right O
of O
taxing O
the O
colonies B-Location
? O

What O
purpose O
then O
can O
be O
served O
by O
these O
pamphlets O
, O
but O
to O
embitter O
the O
minds O
of O
a O
simple O
, O
credulous O
, O
and O
hitherto O
loyal O
people O
, O
and O
to O
alienate O
their O
affections O
from O
Great-Britain B-Organization
, O
their O
best O
friend O
, O
their O
protector O
, O
and O
alma O
mater O
? O

A O
different O
behaviour O
would O
be O
much O
more O
prudent O
and O
politick O
. O

If O
we O
have O
any O
thing O
to O
ask O
, O
we O
should O
remember O
that O
diffidence O
and O
modesty O
will O
always O
obtain O
more O
from O
generous O
minds O
, O
than O
frowardness O
and O
impertinence O

The O
act O
of O
the O
thirteenth O
of O
his O
late O
majesty B-Person
, O
entitled O

An O
act O
for O
naturalizing O
of O

better O
have O
been O
omitted O
by O

for O
if O
that O
act O
is O
to O
be O
the O
measure O
of O
the O

rights O
, O
they O
will O
be O
more O
circumscribed O
than O
he O
would O
willingly O
chuse O

In O
that O
act O
, O
there O
is O
a O
proviso O
, O
that O
no O
person O
, O
who O
shall O
become O
a O
natural O

subject O
by O

of O
that O

This O
statute O
confirms O
the O
distinction O
I O
have O
set O
up O
between O
personal O
and O
political O
rights O

After O
naturalization O
, O
foreign O
protestants O
are O
here O
admitted O
subjects O

to O
all O
intents O

; O
that O
is O
, O
to O
the O
full O
enjoyment O
of O
those O
rights O
which O
are O
connected O
with O
the O

by O

Enlarging O
the O
power O
of O

is O
much O
complain O
’ O

of O
by O

I O
shall O
open O
my O
mind O
to O
you O
freely O
on O
this O
head O

It O
is O
notorious O

that O
smuggling O
, O
which O
an O
eminent O
writer O
calls O
a O
crime O
against O
the O
law O
of O
nature O

had O
well O
nigh O
become O
established O
in O
some O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization

Acts O
of O
parliament B-Organization
had O
been O
uniformly O
dispensed O
with O
by O
those O
whose O
duty O
it O
was O
to O
execute O
them O
; O
corruption O
, O
raised O
upon O
the O
ruins O
of O
duty O
and O
virtue O
, O
had O
almost O
grown O
into O
a O
system O
; O
courts O
of O
admiralty O
, O
confined O
within O
small O
territorial O
jurisdictions O
, O
became O
subject O
to O
mercantile O
influence O
; O
and O
the O
king B-Organization
’ O
s O
revenue O
shamefully O
sacrificed O
to O
the O
venality O

perfidiousness O
of O
courts O

— O
If O

my O
friend O

are O
due O
to O
the O

if O
illicit O

is O
to O

put O
an O
end O
to O

as O
ruinous O
to O
the O
welfare O
of O
the O
nation B-Organization
: O
— O
If O
, O
by O
reason O
of O
the O
interested O
views O
of O
traders O
, O
and O
the O
connivance O
of O
courts O
and O
custom-house O

, O
these O
ends O
could O
not O
be O
compassed O
or O
obtained O
in O
the O
common O
and O
ordinary O
way O
; O
tell O
me O
, O
what O
could O
the O
government O
do O
, O
but O
to O
apply O
a O
remedy O
desperate O
as O
the O
disease O
? O

There O
is O
, O
I O
own O
, O
a O
severity O
in O
the O
method O
of O
prosecution O
, O
in O
the O
new O
established O
court B-Organization
of I-Organization
admiralty I-Organization
, O
under O
Doctor B-Person
S I-Person
P I-Person
R I-Person
Y I-Person
, O
here O
; O
but O
it O
is O
a O
severity O
we O
have O
brought O
upon O
ourselves O
. O

When O
every O
mild O
expedient O
, O
to O
stop O
the O
atrocious O
and O
infamous O
practice O
of O
smuggling O
, O
has O
been O
try O
’ O
d O
in O
vain O
, O
the O
government B-Organization
is O
justifiable O
in O
making O
laws O
against O
it O
, O
even O
like O
those O
of O
Draco B-Person
, O
which O
were O
written O
in O
blood O
. O

The O
new O
instituted O
court O
of O
admiralty O
, O
and O
the O
power O
given O
to O
the O
seizer O
, O
are O
doubtless O
intended O
to O
make O
us O
more O
circumspect O
in O
our O
trade O
, O
and O
to O
confine O
the O
merchant O
, O
from O
motives O
of O
fear O
and O
dread O
, O
within O
the O
limits O
of O
a O
fair O
commerce O
. O

“ O
The O
English O
constrain O
the O
merchant O
, O
but O
it O
is O
in O
favour O
of O
commerce O
, O
” O
says O
the O
admired O
Secondat B-Person
. O

This O
is O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
new O
regulations O
, O
both O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
employing O
of O
cutters O
, O
and O
the O
enlarged O
power O
of O
the O
admiralty O
; O
and O
both O
measures O
are O
justifiable O
upon O
the O
same O
principles O
, O
as O
is O
the O
late O
act O
for O
preventing O
murder O
, O
which O
executes O
and O
dissects O
the O
murderer O
at O
surgeonshall O
in O
twenty-four O
hours O
after O
conviction O
. O

But O
notwithstanding O
the O
severity O
of O
this O
act O
, O
let O
me O
add O
, O
that O
no O
harm O
can O
accrue O
to O
the O
honest O
and O
fair O
trader O
, O
so O
long O
as O
the O
crown B-Organization
fills O
the O
admiralty O
department O
with O
an O
upright O

; O
such O
a O
one O
is O

yet O
the O
honourable O
author B-Person
of O
the O
pamphlet O
before O
me O

has O
told O
us O
to O
this O
effect O
; O
That O
it O
is O
very O
well O
known O
this O
judge O
can O
be O
prevailed O
on O
, O
very O
easily O
, O
to O
certify O
, O
upon O
the O
acquittal O
of O
a O

that O
there O
was O
a O

it O

, O
contained O
in O
a O
pamphlet O
published O
by O
authority O
, O
may O
spread O
over O
the O
British B-Location
dominions I-Location
, O
and O
, O
however O
false O
and O
scandalous O
it O
be O
, O
yet O
may O
leave O
a O
shade O
upon O
his O
character O
which O
can O
never O
be O
effaced O

With O
what O
grace O
, O
let O
me O
ask O
you O
, O
do O
such O
reflections O
as O
these O
come O
from O
the O
governor O
of O
a O
colony O
, O
where O
, O
all O
the O
world O
agree O
, O
the O
law O
has O
scarcely O
yet O
dawned O
, O
and O
where O
all O
your O
legal O
rights O
are O
decided O
by O
the O
strength O
of O
that O
faction O
which O
happens O
to O
be O
uppermost O
. O

I O
am O
not O
enough O
skilled O
in O
trade O
to O
know O
whether O
the O
act O
, O
so O
much O
complained O
of O
, O
will O
do O
most O
good O
or O
most O
harm O
; O
and O
I O
wish O
others O
were O
as O
diffident O
of O
their O
knowledge O
in O
this O
particular O
. O

To O
comprehend O
the O
general O
trade O
of O
the O
British B-Organization
nation I-Organization
, O
much O
exceeds O
the O
capacity O
of O
any O
one O
man O
in O
America B-Location
, O
how O
great O
soever O
he O
be O
. O

Trade O
is O
a O
vast O
, O
complicated O
system O
, O
and O
requires O
such O
a O
depth O
of O
genius O
, O
and O
extent O
of O
knowledge O
, O
to O
understand O
it O
, O
that O
little O
minds O
, O
attached O
to O
their O
own O
sordid O
interest O
, O
and O
long O
used O
to O
the O
greatest O
licentiousness O
in O
trade O

are O

and O
must O
be O

very O
incompetent O

Sir B-Person
Andrew I-Person

is O
no O
inhabitant O
of O
Rhode-Island B-Location
colony I-Location

For O
my O
own O
part O
, O
I O
am O
still O
willing O
to O
leave O
the O
management O
of O
trade O
with O
that O
people O
, O
who O
, O
according O
to O
the O
same O
admired O
author B-Person
just O
quoted O
, O
“ O
know O
better O
than O
any O
other O
people O
upon O

, O
how O
to O
value O
at O
the O

time O
these O
three O
great O
advantages O

, O

and O
liberty O

” O

Here O
I O
would O
just O
observe O
, O
that O
, O
from O
the O
intelligence O
I O
have O
gained O
, O
the O
beloved O
article O
of O
melasses O
is O
now O
plentier O
and O
cheaper O
, O
in O
all O
the O
NewEngland B-Location
colonies I-Location
, O
than O
when O
it O
was O
avowedly O
smuggled O
; O
and O
so O
far O
is O
the O
linen O
manufacture O
of O
Ireland B-Location
from O
being O
ruined O
, O
as O
his O
honour B-Person
intimates O
, O
that O
never O
was O
a O
greater O
demand O
for O
flax-seed O
than O
during O
the O
last O
fall O
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
clause O
in O
the O
act O
relating O
to O
lumber O
. O

How O
senseless O
is O
it O
to O
imagine O
that O
the O
prohibiting O
a O
few O
dunnage O
staves O
to O
be O
carried O
to O
Ireland B-Location
, O
will O
ruin O
the O
manufactures O
of O
that O
kingdom B-Location
. O

Believe O
me O
, O
my O
Friend O
, O
it O
gives O
me O
great O
pain O
to O
see O
so O
much O
ingratitude O
in O
the O
colonies B-Location
to O
the O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
, O
whose O
arms O
and O
money O
so O
lately O
rescued O
them O
from O
a O
French B-Organization
government I-Organization
. O

I O
have O
been O
told O
, O
that O
some O
have O
gone O
so O
far O
as O
to O
say O
, O
that O
they O
would O
, O
as O
things O
are O
, O
prefer O
such O
a O
government O
to O
an O
English O
one O
. O

— O
Heaven O
knows O
I O
have O
but O
little O
malice O
in O
my O
heart O
, O
yet O
, O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
I O
ardently O
wish O
that O
these O
spurious O
, O
unworthy O
sons O
of O
Britain B-Organization
could O
feel O
the O
iron O
rod O
of O
a O
Spanish O
inquisitor O
, O
or O
a O
French O
farmer O
of O
the O
revenue O
; O
it O
would O
indeed O
be O
a O
punishment O
suited O
to O
their O
ingratitude O
. O

Here O
I O
cannot O
but O
call O
to O
mind O
the O
adder O
in O
one O
of O
the O
fables O
of O
Pilpay B-Person
, O
which O
was O
preparing O
to O
sting O
the O
generous O
traveller O
who O
had O
just O
rescued O
him O
from O
the O
flames O
. O

You O
’ O
l O
easily O
perceive O
, O
that O
what O
I O
have O
said O
is O
upon O
the O
general O
design O
of O
his O
honour B-Person
’ O
s O
pamphlet O
; O
if O
he O
had O
divided O
his O
argument O
with O
any O
precision O
, O
I O
would O
have O
followed O
him O
with O
somewhat O
more O
of O
method O
; O
The O
dispute O
between O
Great-Britain B-Organization
and O
the O
colonies B-Organization
consists O
of O
two O
parts O
; O
first O
, O
the O
jurisdiction O
of O
parliament B-Organization
, O
— O
and O
, O
secondly O
, O
the O
exercise O
of O
that O
jurisdiction O
. O

His O
honour B-Person
hath O
blended O
these O
together O
, O
and O
no O
where O
marked O
the O
division O
between O
them O
: O
The O
first O
I O
have O
principally O
remarked O
upon O
: O
As O
to O
the O
second O
, O
it O
can O
only O
turn O
upon O
the O
expediency O
or O
utility O
of O
those O
schemes O
which O
may O
, O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
be O
adopted O
by O
parliament B-Organization
, O
relative O
to O
the O
colonies B-Organization
. O

Under O
this O
head O
, O
I O
readily O
grant O
, O
they O
are O
at O
full O
liberty O
to O
remonstrate O
, O
petition O
, O
write O
pamphlets O
and O
newspapers O
, O
without O
number O
, O
to O
prevent O
any O
improper O
or O
unreasonable O
imposition O
: O
Nay O
, O
I O
would O
have O
them O
do O
all O
this O
with O
that O
spirit O
of O
freedom O
which O
Englishmen O
always O
have O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
ever O
will O
, O
exert O
; O
but O
let O
us O
not O
use O
our O
liberty O
for O
a O
cloak O
of O
maliciousness O
. O

Indeed O
I O
am O
very O
sure O
the O
loyalty O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
has O
ever O
been O
irreproachable O
; O
but O
from O
the O
pride O
of O
some O
, O
and O
the O
ignorance O
of O
others O
, O
the O
cry O
against O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
has O
spread O
from O
colony O
to O
colony O
; O
and O
it O
is O
to O
be O
feared O
, O
that O
prejudices O
and O
resentments O
are O
kindled O
among O
them O
which O
it O
will O
be O
difficult O
ever O
, O
thoroughly O
, O
to O
sooth O
or O
extinguish O
. O

It O
may O
become O
necessary O
for O
the O
supreme B-Organization
legislature I-Organization
of I-Organization
the I-Organization
nation I-Organization
to O
frame O
some O
code O
, O
and O
therein O
adjust O
the O
rights O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
with O
precision O
and O
certainty O
, O
otherwise O
Great-Britain B-Organization
will O
always O
be O
teazed O
with O
new O
claims O
about O
liberty O
and O
privileges O
. O

I O
have O
no O
ambition O
in O
appearing O
in O
print O
, O
yet O
if O
you O
think O
what O
is O
here O
thrown O
together O
is O
fit O
for O
the O
publick O
eye O
, O
you O
are O
at O
liberty O
to O
publish O
it O
: O
I O
the O
more O
chearfully O
acquiesce O
in O
this O
, O
because O
it O
is O
with O
real O
concern O
I O
have O
observed O
, O
that O
, O
notwithstanding O
the O
frequent O
abuse O
poured O
forth O
in O
pamphlets O
and O
news-papers O
against O
the O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
, O
not O
one O
filial O
pen O
