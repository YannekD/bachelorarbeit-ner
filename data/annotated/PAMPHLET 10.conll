, O
William B-Person
Pitt I-Person
, O
the O
“ O
Great O
Commoner O
” O
and O
the O
minister O
most O
responsible O
for O
Britain B-Organization
’ O
s O
winning O
the O
Seven O
Years O
War O
, O
gave O
an O
impassioned O
speech O
in O
Parliament B-Organization
in O
opposition O
to O
the O
Stamp O
Act O
. O

It O
ought O
to O
be O
“ O
repealed O
absolutely O
, O
totally O
, O
and O
immediately O
; O
” O
he O
insisted O
, O
because O
“ O
it O
was O
founded O
on O
an O
erroneous O
principle O
. O
” O

Parliament B-Organization
, O
Pitt B-Person
said O
, O
had O
no O
right O
to O
take O
money O
out O
of O
the O
colonists O
’ O
pockets O
. O

Not O
only O
did O
Pitt B-Person
defend O
the O
Americans O
’ O
claim O
that O
they O
could O
not O
be O
taxed O
without O
their O
consent O
, O
he O
even O
rejoiced O
that O
they O
had O
resisted O
. O

Couldn O
’ O
t O
the O
British B-Organization
government I-Organization
, O
he O
asked O
, O
understand O
the O
“ O
plain O
distinction O
between O
taxes O
levied O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
raising O
a O
revenue O
, O
and O
duties O
imposed O
for O
the O
regulation O
of O
trade O
” O
? O

The O
speech O
was O
widely O
printed O
in O
the O
colonies B-Location
and O
made O
him O
an O
American O
hero O
all O
over O
again O
. O

But O
as O
William B-Person
Hicks I-Person
pointed O
out O
in O
a O
series O
of O
essays O
originally O
published O
in O
the O
Pennsylvania O
Journal O
early O
in O
1768 O
and O
reprinted O
in O
newspapers O
in O
Boston B-Location
and O
South B-Location
Carolina I-Location
before O
being O
collected O
in O
this O
pamphlet O
, O
Pitt B-Person
had O
revealed O
“ O
a O
striking O
inconsistency O
” O
in O
his O
speech O
. O

While O
Parliament B-Organization
could O
not O
tax O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
Pitt B-Person
had O
claimed O
that O
it O
had O
“ O
a O
right O
to O
bind O
, O
to O
restrain O
America B-Organization
” O
and O
that O
its O
“ O
legislative O
power O
over O
the O
colonies B-Organization
is O
sovereign O
and O
supreme O
. O
” O

Indeed O
, O
Pitt B-Person
felt O
Parliament B-Organization
was O
more O
than O
justified O
in O
suspending O
the O
New B-Organization
York I-Organization
Assembly I-Organization
over O
its O
refusal O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
Quartering O
Act O
of O
1765 O
, O
an O
action O
that O
had O
deeply O
troubled O
leaders O
throughout O
the O
colonies B-Location
. O

How O
could O
this O
inconsistency O
be O
understood O
? O

Could O
the O
colonists O
really O
be O
subordinate O
to O
“ O
the O
two O
inferior O
estates O
of O
their O
mother B-Organization
country I-Organization
, O
” O
that O
is O
, O
to O
the O
House B-Organization
of I-Organization
Lords I-Organization
and O
the O
House B-Organization
of I-Organization
Commons I-Organization
? O

Shouldn O
’ O
t O
they O
instead O
be O
“ O
considered O
as O
so O
many O
different O
countries O
of O
the O
same O
kingdom B-Organization
” O
? O

Like O
many O
other O
Americans O
, O
Hicks B-Person
was O
fumbling O
to O
find O
some O
way O
“ O
through O
the O
labyrinth O
of O
our O
present O
dispute O
. O
” O

How O
could O
Parliament B-Organization
, O
as O
Pitt B-Person
claimed O
, O
bind O
the O
trade O
of O
the O
colonists O
, O
confine O
their O
manufactures O
, O
and O
exercise O
every O
power O
whatsoever O
over O
them O
, O
except O
tax O
them O
? O

Could O
Parliament B-Organization
be O
limited O
and O
yet O
unlimited O
at O
the O
same O
time O
? O

The O
Great B-Person
Commoner I-Person
did O
not O
have O
an O
answer O
to O
these O
questions O
, O
and O
it O
seemed O
no O
one O
else O
did O
either O

T O
following O
piece O
was O
written O
but O
a O
short O
time O
before O
the O
repeal O
of O
the O
stamp-act O
; O
and O
as O
the O
subject O
of O
it O
was O
of O
the O
most O
general O
and O
HE O
important O
nature O
, O
the O
trifling O
alteration O
of O
circumstances O
which O
a O
few O
months O
have O
produced O
, O
cannot O
prevent O
its O
being O
as O
applicable O
to O
the O
present O
state O
of O
our O
affairs O
, O
as O
to O
those O
disagreeable O
controversies O
, O
in O
which O
we O
have O
been O
heretofore O
unhappily O
involved O
. O

The O
conciliating O
spirit O
which O
prevaled O
upon O
the O
first O
intelligence O
of O
the O
stamp-act O
’ O
s O
being O
repealed O
, O
prevented O
its O
publication O
then O
; O
though O
the O
author B-Person
was O
ever O
perfectly O
convinced O
, O
the O
colonies B-Organization
would O
not O
long O
have O
any O
reason O
to O
flatter O
themselves O
, O
that O
the O
repeal O
of O
this O
act O
was O
a O
sacrifice O
to O
liberty O
; O
or O
that O
it O
proceeded O
from O
any O
thing O
more O
than O
an O
apprehension O
of O
the O
ill O
consequences O
which O
our O
brethren O
of O
Britain B-Location
must O
have O
felt O
from O
the O
œconomical O
resolutions O
which O
we O
had O
formed O
. O

Upon O
examining O
the O
debates O
, O
previous O
to O
the O
repeal O
, O
if O
any O
one O
could O
have O
doubted O
the O
sense O
of O
the O
legislature B-Organization
, O
the O
act O
for O
securing O
the O
dependence O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
would O
have O
reduced O
it O
to O
a O
sufficient O
degree O
of O
certainty O
. O

Indeed O
, O
if O
this O
act O
had O
been O
more O
equivocal O
, O
the O
billeting O
act O
was O
explicit O
enough O
to O
have O
pointed O
out O
clearly O
to O
every O
common O
understanding O
, O
their O
generous O
meaning—A O
meaning O
evidenced O
by O
such O
measures O
as O
could O
not O
but O
excite O
the O
most O
alarming O
apprehensions O
. O

In O
mixt O
forms O
of O
government O
, O
where O
the O
delicacy O
of O
the O
constitution O
requires O
the O
strictest O
attention O
, O
to O
the O
movements O
of O
each O
distinct O
part O
, O
jealous O
fears O
frequently O
intervene O
, O
upon O
the O
slightest O
appearance O
of O
irregularity O
. O

The O
history O
of O
England B-Organization
, O
alone O
, O
will O
furnish O
us O
with O
facts O
sufficient O
to O
support O
this O
assertion O
; O
since O
every O
man O
who O
possesses O
the O
smallest O
share O
of O
historical O
knowledge O
must O
certainly O
have O
observed O
, O
that O
before O
any O
measure O
of O
importance O
could O
obtain O
the O
necessary O
approbation O
of O
the O
three O
estates O
of O
the O
kingdom B-Organization
, O
it O
first O
passed O
a O
severe O
and O
critical O
examination O
; O
lest O
a O
superior O
address O
in O
either O
of O
the O
parties O
interested O
, O
should O
give O
them O
some O
particular O
advantage—lest O
a O
designing O
minister O
should O
extend O
the O
prerogative O
of O
the O
crown B-Organization
, O
or O
an O
artful O
commoner O
increase O
the O
liberty O
of O
the O
subject O
. O

A O
few O
thousands O
added O
to O
the O
military O
list O
, O
have O
alarmed O
the O
whole O
nation B-Organization
; O
and O
a O
body O
of O
troops O
, O
not O
equal O
to O
those O
upon O
the O
American O
establishment O
, O
have O
with O
the O
most O
terrible O
apprehensions O
, O
been O
considered O
as O
a O
formidable O
army O
, O
— O
so O
averse O
have O
the O
people O
of O
England B-Location
ever O
been O
, O
to O
trust O
their O
liberties O
, O
even O
with O
the O
best O
of O
men O
, O
that O
they O
have O
chosen O
to O
depend O
upon O
the O
precarious O
aid O
of O
subsidiary O
troops O
, O
rather O
than O
put O
arms O
into O
the O
hands O
of O
their O
own O
countrymen O
: O
while O
there O
was O
the O
least O
probability O
that O
those O
arms O
might O
be O
employed O
to O
the O
subversion O
of O
liberty O
. O

This O
conduct O
, O
I O
only O
mean O
to O
remark O
as O
consistent O
with O
the O
genius O
of O
liberty O
: O
and O
, O
though O
its O
policy O
, O
when O
critically O
examined O
, O
may O
not O
appear O
altogether O
unexceptionable O
, O
yet O
will O
the O
jealous O
caution O
which O
produced O
it O
, O
be O
ever O
considered O
as O
the O
grand O
bulwark O
of O
freedom O
. O

When O
I O
apply O
myself O
to O
consider O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
colonists O
, O
I O
cannot O
but O
observe O
that O
they O
labour O
under O
difficulties O
peculiar O
to O
themselves O
. O

They O
have O
not O
only O
to O
guard O
their O
liberties O
against O
the O
encroachments O
of O
the O
royal O
prerogative O
, O
but O
even O
to O
protect O
their O
property O
against O
the O
invasions O
of O
their O
more O
powerful O
brethren O
. O

The O
people O
of O
England B-Location
have O
only O
one O
single O
defence O
to O
make O
for O
the O
preservation O
of O
their O
freedom O
; O
and O
, O
if O
the O
system O
of O
venality O
and O
corruption O
, O
which O
now O
so O
generally O
prevails O
, O
does O
not O
gradually O
lead O
them O
into O
a O
state O
of O
slavery O
, O
no O
open O
violence O
can O
ever O
effect O
it O
. O

Far O
different O
is O
the O
situation O
of O
the O
divided O
Americans O
. O

Of O
them O
every O
distinct O
colony O
has O
hitherto O
been O
considered O
as O
a O
particular O
plantation O
of O
the O
crown B-Organization
, O
and O
been O
governed O
by O
such O
loose O
, O
discretionary O
powers O
as O
were O
better O
calculated O
to O
support O
the O
despotism O
of O
a O
minister O
than O
the O
liberties O
of O
the O
settlers O
. O

They O
are O
now O
considered O
as O
dangerous O
rivals O
, O
and O
their O
unprotected O
interests O
must O
fall O
a O
sacrifice O
to O
those O
of O
their O
jealous O
brethren O
. O

An O
artful O
, O
designing O
minister O
would O
naturally O
endeavour O
to O
conciliate O
the O
affections O
of O
those O
who O
more O
immediately O
surround O
the O
throne O
, O
by O
removing O
any O
burthens O
from O
their O
shoulders O
, O
and O
fixing O
them O
upon O
those O
, O
by O
whose O
murmers O
and O
complaints O
, O
he O
could O
not O
be O
so O
immediately O
affected O
. O

To O
gratify O
the O
desires O
of O
his O
selfish O
countrymen O
, O
and O
flatter O
them O
with O
the O
appearance O
of O
an O
unnatural O
superiority O
; O
he O
would O
willingly O
subscribe O
to O
any O
acts O
for O
the O
limiting O
our O
trade O
, O
and O
restraining O
our O
manufactures O
: O
But O
perfectly O
convinced O
that O
the O
Americans O
will O
neither O
be O
so O
stupid O
as O
not O
to O
perceive O
the O
iniquity O
of O
these O
measures O
, O
nor O
so O
passive O
as O
patiently O
to O
submit O
to O
their O
being O
carried O
into O
execution O
, O
he O
prudently O
prepares O
to O
support O
them O
by O
means O
as O
infamous O
and O
oppressive O
as O
those O
which O
are O
to O
be O
supported O
. O

Though O
our O
European O
neighbours O
are O
driven O
from O
the O
continent B-Location
; O
and O
, O
though O
our O
savage O
enemies O
have O
long O
since O
laid O
down O
the O
hatchet O
, O
yet O
have O
our O
careful O
guardians O
left O
us O
a O
very O
considerable O
body O
of O
troops O
, O
and O
are O
daily O
sending O
over O
fresh O
supplies—to O
protect O
us O
from O
any O
future O
dangers O
; O
when O
it O
cannot O
but O
be O
evident O
to O
every O
man O
of O
common O
knowledge O
, O
that O
, O
in O
our O
present O
situation O
, O
we O
are O
both O
able O
and O
willing O
to O
defend O
our O
own O
frontiers O
, O
without O
putting O
the O
government B-Organization
to O
the O
trouble O
of O
transporting O
troops O
for O
that O
purpose O
, O
at O
such O
an O
immense O
expence O
. O

We O
have O
now O
sixteen O
regiments O
distributed O
through O
the O
different O
colonies B-Location
. O

— O
most O
of O
them O
, O
instead O
of O
being O
a O
defence O
to O
our O
frontiers O
, O
are O
a O
burthen O
to O
our O
maritime O
cities O
; O
where O
they O
are O
, O
by O
virtue O
of O
an O
act O
of O
the O
British B-Organization
parliament I-Organization
, O
to O
be O
plentifully O
supplied O
with O
necessaries O
at O
the O
expence O
of O
the O
place O
where O
they O
may O
be O
quartered O
; O
and O
as O
the O
quartering O
them O
depends O
altogether O
upon O
the O
arbitrary O
will O
of O
the O
commanding O
officer O
, O
he O
is O
absolutely O
vested O
with O
a O
power O
of O
oppressing O
any O
single O
colony O
, O
which O
may O
have O
been O
so O
unfortunate O
as O
to O
have O
incurred O
the O
resentment O
of O
those O
who O
appointed O
him O
. O

When O
the O
ministry B-Organization
resolved O
to O
burthen O
us O
with O
so O
many O
troops O
, O
it O
was O
not O
thought O
proper O
to O
make O
the O
usual O
requisitions O
to O
the O
different O
assemblies O
for O
the O
necessary O
supplies O
. O

The O
power O
of O
parliament B-Organization
had O
met O
with O
an O
unexpected O
opposition O
, O
in O
their O
first O
attempts O
to O
enforce O
the O
stamp-act O
. O

Urged O
by O
a O
prudent O
attention O
to O
their O
own O
interests O
, O
they O
had O
indeed O
determined O
to O
repeal O
this O
oppressive O
act O
; O
but O
, O
least O
this O
extraordinary O
concession O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
an O
acknowledgement O
of O
right O
, O
they O
determined O
to O
exert O
their O
authority O
once O
more O
in O
a O
manner O
so O
explicit O
, O
as O
should O
leave O
us O
no O
room O
to O
doubt O
their O
meaning O
. O

One O
act O
is O
passed O
to O
declare O
the O
dependence O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
upon O
the O
imperial O
crown B-Organization
and O
parliament B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great-Britain I-Organization
; O
and O
that O
dependence O
is O
immediately O
proved O
by O
a O
law O
for O
billeting O
soldiers O
in O
America B-Organization
, O
and O
for O
obliging O
those O
places O
, O
in O
which O
the O
commanding O
officer O
may O
think O
proper O
to O
quarter O
them O
, O
to O
grant O
certain O
very O
ample O
supplies O
of O
necessaries O
. O

Upon O
application O
to O
the O
government B-Organization
of I-Organization
New-York I-Organization
, O
the O
general B-Organization
assembly I-Organization
of O
that O
province O
shewed O
their O
readiness O
to O
comply O
with O
every O
thing O
that O
might O
be O
required O
for O
the O
accommodation O
of O
those O
troops O
which O
had O
contributed O
to O
the O
valuable O
acquisitions O
in O
America B-Location
. O

They O
framed O
a O
law O
for O
the O
purpose O
, O
and O
granted O
a O
sufficiency O
of O
such O
articles O
as O
they O
conceived O
most O
useful O
and O
necessary O
for O
the O
soldiers O
: O
They O
did O
not O
indeed O
comply O
with O
every O
particular O
contained O
in O
the O
act O
of O
parliament— I-Organization
perhaps O
it O
might O
not O
be O
in O
their O
power O
. O

If O
any O
thing O
was O
to O
be O
given O
by O
the O
colonists O
for O
the O
accommodation O
of O
the O
soldiery O
, O
surely O
they O
were O
the O
best O
judges O
of O
their O
own O
abilities O
, O
as O
well O
as O
of O
those O
articles O
which O
they O
could O
most O
conveniently O
procure O
. O

If O
the O
parliament B-Organization
had O
thought O
proper O
to O
have O
ordered O
porter O
instead O
of O
small O
beer O
, O
and O
gin O
instead O
of O
rum O
, O
they O
would O
scarcely O
have O
procured O
a O
sufficient O
quantity O
, O
had O
they O
even O
sought O
it O
with O
fixt O
bayonets O
. O

Although O
the O
inhabitants O
could O
not O
but O
be O
alarmed O
at O
a O
requisition O
supported O
by O
the O
whole O
legislative O
authority O
, O
yet O
did O
they O
prudently O
decline O
taking O
notice O
of O
such O
an O
extraordinary O
procedure O
, O
and O
very O
modestly O
resolved O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
design O
of O
the O
act O
without O
any O
immediate O
referrence O
to O
the O

MR O

PITT B-Person
has O
frequently O
declared O
that O
the O
freemen O
of O
Great-Britain B-Organization
have O
no O
right O
to O
take O
money O
out O
of O
our O
pockets O
, O
without O
first O
obtaining O
our O
consent O
; O
and O
yet O
their O
representatives O
in O
parliament B-Organization
have O
resolved O
, O
without O
deigning O
to O
consult O
us O
, O
that O
we O
shall O
pay O
a O
certain O
sum O
for O
furnishing O
the O
soldiery O
with O
particular O
necessaries O
. O

Unwilling O
to O
revive O
a O
contest O
, O
which O
had O
just O
before O
been O
settled O
so O
much O
to O
our O
satisfaction O
, O
we O
declined O
renewing O
the O
dispute O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
legality O
of O
the O
act O
. O

We O
were O
contented O
to O
receive O
it O
as O
a O
reasonable O
requisition O
, O
though O
not O
as O
a O
binding O
law O
; O
and O
, O
consulting O
our O
own O
abilities O
and O
convenience O
, O
we O
granted O
such O
articles O
as O
we O
thought O
would O
answer O
the O
design O
of O
the O
act O
. O

In O
this O
conduct O
, O
so O
remarkably O
temperate O
, O
we O
have O
incurred O
the O
highest O
displeasure O
of O
the O
British B-Organization
parliament I-Organization
, O
and O
are O
exposed O
, O
as O
a O
punishment O
due O
to O
our O
offences O
, O
to O
one O
of O
the O
most O
general O
, O
and O
severest O
penalties O
which O
the O
hand O
of O
power O
could O
inflict O
. O

An O
act O
has O
passed O
to O
strip O
us O
of O
our O
legislative O
power O
, O
and O
render O
us O
unable O
to O
provide O
for O
ourselves O
in O
a O
situation O
of O
the O
most O
imminent O
danger O
; O
because O
we O
have O
outrageously O
refused O
to O
subscribe O
to O
our O
own O
ruin O
. O

We O
have O
modestly O
avoided O
controverting O
a O
point O
of O
the O
highest O
importance O
, O
lest O
we O
should O
draw O
upon O
ourselves O
a O
charge O
of O
obstinacy O
and O
malevolence O
. O

We O
have O
complyed O
with O
the O
meaning O
, O
though O
not O
with O
the O
letter O
of O
the O
act O
. O

We O
have O
evidenced O
the O
most O
grateful O
and O
complying O
disposition O
, O
and O
are O
nevertheless O
doomed O
to O
receive O
the O
punishment O
of O
the O
most O
rebelious O
opposition O
. O

If O
our O
every O
act O
is O
thus O
liable O
to O
be O
misconstrued O
, O
and O
we O
are O
patiently O
to O
receive O
such O
severe O
chastisement O
, O
we O
must O
at O
once O
renounce O
the O
name O
of O
free-men O
, O
and O
accommodate O
ourselves O
to O
a O
state O
of O
abject O
vassallage O
. O

We O
may O
not O
, O
perhaps O
, O
just O
now O
feel O
any O
immediate O
ill O
consequences O
from O
this O
restraint O
upon O
our O
legislation O
; O
but O
, O
when O
we O
are O
to O
determine O
upon O
the O
propriety O
or O
justice O
of O
any O
particular O
act O

we O
are O
to O
consider O
all O
the O
effects O
which O
it O
may O
probably O
, O
or O
even O
possibly O
produce O
. O

Suppose O
( O
for O

) O
that O
our O
savage O
neighbours O
should O
once O
more O
wantonly O
invade O
our O
frontiers B-Location
—to O
what O
a O
horrid O
situation O
should O
we O
be O
reduced O
! O

Our O
lives O

exposed O

the O

a O

enemy O

without O
our O

raise O
either O
men O

Can O
the O
greatest O
enemy O

think O
of O
our O
being O
reduced O
to O
a O
situation O
so O
truly O
distressful O
, O
without O
accusing O
of O
the O
most O
unnatural O
severity O
, O
those O
who O
arrogate O
to O
themselves O
an O
absolute O
power O
of O
directing O
and O
restraining O
our O
every O
action O
, O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
as O
may O
best O
answer O
their O
own O
partial O
purposes O

In O
this O
amazing O
exertion O
of O

the O

not O

It O
may O
hereafter O
be O
the O
fate O

unless O
they O
now O
cordially O
unite O
in O
such O
an O
application O
as O
may O
confirm O
their O
liberty O

or O
establish O
their O
subordination O
upon O
some O
regular O
principles O

I O
am O
no O
favourer O
of O
violent O
measures O

I O
would O
endeavour O
to O
support O
our O
pretensions O
by O
force O
of O
reasoning O
, O
not O
by O
force O
of O
arms O
; O
but O
yet O
I O
would O
anxiously O
wish O
that O
nothing O
may O
intimidate O
us O
into O
an O
acquiescence O
with O
the O
measures O
of O
oppression O
. O

We O
may O
be O
compelled O
to O
submit O
, O
but O
never O
to O
relinquish O
our O
claim O
to O
the O
privileges O
of O
the O
free O
men O
. O

When O
we O
complain O
of O
the O
violent O
proceedings O
in O
the O
late O
administrations B-Organization
; O
let O
us O
consider O
the O
alterations O
which O
a O
century O
has O
produced O
in O
our O
constitution O
. O

We O
have O
now O
a O
standing O
army O
of O
one O
hundred O
and O
twenty O
regiments O
. O

Scarce O
a O
family O
of O
rank O
but O
what O
has O
some O
military O
connections O
; O
and O
even O
in O
the O
house B-Organization
of I-Organization
commons I-Organization
there O
are O
too O
many O
gentlemen O
of O
the O
sword O
. O

No O
wonder O
then O
that O
we O
are O
alarmed O
with O
such O
spirited O
resolves—that O
execution O
is O
to O
proceed O
judgment O
; O
and O
that O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
a O
colony O
are O
regarded O
as O
dependant O
vassals O
, O
by O
those O
who O
have O
been O
accustomed O
to O
consider O
a O
legion O
of O
free O
subjects O
, O
as O
a O
band O
of O
absolute O
slaves—points O
of O
honor O
now O
take O
place O
of O
points O
in O
law O
, O
and O
Magna-Charta O
itself O
must O
give O
way O
to O
that O
furor O
militaris O
which O
so O
universally O
prevails O
. O

The O
hand O
which O
bestows O
a O
truncheon O
can O
never O
be O
guilty O
of O
oppression O
, O
and O
the O
will O
of O
an O
artful O
minister O
will O
become O
the O
law O
of O
a O
whole O
nation B-Organization

I O
am O
no O
enemy O
to O
the O
present O
military O
establishment O
, O
but O
as O
I O
conceive O
it O
may O
influence O

I O
any O

gave O
birth O
to O
my O

when O
I O
consider O
them O
as O
exerting O
their O
superior O
power O
to O
reduce O
their O
fellow O
subjects O
to O
a O
state O
of O
subordination O
inconsistent O
with O
their O
natural O
rights O

and O
not O
to O

to O
the O

I O
admire O

revere O
the O

regulated O
government B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great-Britain I-Organization

and O
only O
wish O
to O
have O
our O

established O

so O
excellent O
a O
standard O

As O
a O
colonist O
, O
my O
most O
ambitious O
views O
extend O
no O
further O
than O
the O
rights O
of O
a O
British O
subject O
. O

I O
can O
not O
comprehend O
how O
my O
being O
born O
in O
America B-Location
should O
divest O
me O
of O
these O
; O
nor O
can O
I O
conceive O
why O
the O
liberty O
and O
property O
of O
a O
free-born O
American O
should O
not O
be O
protected O
from O
every O
invasion O
with O
the O
same O
caution O
, O
which O
has O
ever O
been O
exerted O
to O
guard O
the O
privileges O
of O
an O
englishman O
. O

If O
we O
are O
entitled O
to O
the O
liberties O
of O
British O

we O
ought O
to O
enjoy O
them O
unlimited O

If O
our O

without O
any O

In O
acts O
of O
the O
greatest O
solemnity O
and O
notoriety O

we O
have O
been O
flattered O
with O
the O
title O

have O
received O
with O
the O
blood O
of O
our O

the O
spirit O
of O
liberty O
, O
and O
our O
hearts O
naturally O
retain O
an O
utter O
abhorrence O
of O

We O
have O
carefully O
examined O
those O
glorious O
charters O

granted O
to O
the O
virtuous O
resolution O
of O
our O
brave O
fore-fathers O
; O
and O
the O
result O
of O
our O
examination O
can O
not O
but O
inform O
us—that O
liberty O
is O
only O
to O
be O
supported O
by O
a O
steady O
opposition O

the O

The O

that O

such O

The O
commons B-Organization

might O
indeed O
with O
great O
propriety O
propose O
regulations O

how O

what O

Would O
they O

a O
certain O

indeed O
, O
whatever O

that O
to O
fix O

purposes O

only O
, O
would O
be O

every O

who O
has O
the O
cause O
of O
liberty O
, O
and O
the O
interest O
of O
his O
country O
at O

, O
would O
rather O
accept O
such O
a O
partial O
, O
disadvantageous O
establishment O
as O
might O
immediately O
be O
obtained O
, O
than O
submit O
to O
such O
an O
unnatural O
state O
of O
subordination O

as O
must O
continually O
keep O
alive O
the O
spirit O

finally O
involve O

The O
friends O
of O

lose O
themselves O
in O
contemplating O
the O
idol O
they O
have O
raised O
; O
and O
to O
confirm O
the O
veneration O
which O
they O
have O
entertained O

they O
annex O
to O
it O
the O
idea O
of O
omnipotence O

It O
is O
a O
received O
maxim O
of O
the O

— O
“ O
that O
the O
king B-Organization
can O
do O
no O
wrong O
” O
; O
and O
yet O
our O
brave O
forefathers O
were O
not O
so O
deluded O
by O
this O
royal O
dogma O
as O
to O
suffer O
themselves O
to O
be O
stripped O
of O
their O
invaluable O
rights O
and O
privileges O
by O
the O
arbitrary O
fiat O
of O
a O
wicked O
Prince O
; O
and O
if O
they O
were O
justifiable O
in O
their O
resolute O
opposition O
to O
the O
unwarrantable O
encroachments O
of O
a O
power O
which O
had O
been O
considered O
as O
sacred O
, O
by O
a O
long O
hereditary O
succession O
; O
how O
very O
reasonably O
may O
we O
conceive O
that O
our O
conduct O
will O
be O
strictly O
defensible O
when O
we O
unanimously O
oppose O
the O
violent O
proceedings O
of O
a O
body O
which O
we O
may O
be O
said O
, O
from O
day O
to O
day O
, O
to O
have O
fashioned O
with O
our O
own O
hands O
. O

As O
the O
original O
design O
of O
delegating O
power O
, O
was O
, O
that O
it O
might O
be O
exercised O
for O
the O
good O
of O
the O
whole O
community O
, O
there O
cannot O
be O
a O
greater O
absurdity O
in O
politics O
than O
to O
suppose O
that O
those O
whom O
we O
have O
vested O
with O
a O
reasonable O
and O
necessary O
authority O
, O
are O
not O
accountable O
to O
us O
if O
they O
should O
, O
by O
any O
consideration O

be O
led O
weakly O

it O

doctrine O
of O
non O
resistance O

obedience O
to O
the O
tyranic O
will O
of O
a O
wicked O
Prince O
has O
long O
since O
been O
exploded O
, O
and O
those O
who O
have O
endeavoured O
to O
inculcate O
these O
slavish O
principles O
have O
deservedly O
been O
treated O
with O
the O
utmost O
rigor O
of O
the O

If O
liberty O

the O
object O
which O
we O
pursue O

the O

we O
most O
cautiously O

we O
have O
as O
much O
to O
apprehend O
from O
a O
corrupt O

from O

of O

that O

would O
rather O

in O

I O

to O
remark O

that O

that O
those O

inculcated O

attempt O
to O
strip O

would O

not O
meet O

as O
if O
the O

by O
an O

of O
its O

endeavour O
to O
divest O
them O

The O

that O

Should O

the O
rights O

those O
who O
cloathed O

only O
be O
considered O
as O
a O

if O
the O

should O
be O
exerted O
to O
deprive O
us O

we O
must O
very O
properly O
regard O

an O
act O

been O
offered O
to O
the O

foundation O
of O

liberty O

Those O
, O
whose O
situation O
had O
lately O
been O
that O
of O
the O
most O
abject O
vassallage O
, O
now O
suddenly O
found O
themselves O
raised O
, O
by O
their O
own O
industry O
, O
to O
the O
possession O
of O
wealth O
and O
independence O
. O

Proud O
of O
such O
valuable O
and O
important O
acquisitions O
, O
they O
only O
waited O
for O
that O
information O
, O
which O
was O
the O
child O
of O
time O
and O
experience O
, O
to O
direct O
their O
steps O
in O
the O
pursuit O
of O
measures O
which O
were O
to O
establish O
the O
most O
solid O
security O
for O
that O
liberty O
and O
property O
which O
they O
had O
so O
lately O
acquired O
. O

Before O
science O
extended O
her O
happy O
influence O
over O
this O
rising O
nation B-Organization
, O
their O
progress O
in O
the O
paths O
of O
liberty O
was O
but O
slow O
and O
irregular—interrupted O
by O
events O
which O
they O
were O
too O
short O
sighted O
to O
foresee O
, O
and O
obstructed O
by O
revolutions O
which O
no O
human O
prudence O
could O
prevent O
. O

But O
, O
when O
their O
acquisition O
of O
knowledge O
, O
from O
a O
careful O
examination O
of O
the O
past O
, O
enabled O
them O
not O
only O
to O
regulate O
the O
present O
, O
but O
even O
to O
penetrate O
into O
the O
remote O
regions O
of O
future O
contingency O
, O
every O
revolving O
year O
furnished O
them O
with O
some O
opportunity O
to O
improve O
and O
enlarge O
their O
system O
of O
liberty O
. O

With O
every O
assistance O
which O
human O
wisdom O
could O
bestow O
, O
supported O
by O
the O
experience O
of O
ages O
, O
they O
have O
at O
last O
fixed O
the O
foundation O
of O
their O
freedom O
upon O
such O
principles O
as O
will O
forever O
stand O
the O
test O
of O
the O
most O
critical O
examination O
. O

Careful O
to O
guard O
those O
blessings O
for O
which O
they O
had O
so O
industriously O
laboured O
, O
they O
established O
this O
as O
a O
fundamental O
maxim—that O
no O
new O
regulation O
could O
be O
framed O
, O
nor O
any O
old O
law O
abrogated O
but O
by O
the O
general O
consent O
of O
the O
nation B-Organization
. O

Such O
a O
consent O
as O
must O
be O
evidenced O
by O
a O
majority O
of O
votes O
in O
the O
different O
estates O
of O
the O
kingdom B-Organization
—the O
Lords B-Organization
in O
their O
proper O
persons O
assenting O
, O
while O
the O
sense O
of O
the O
common O
people O
is O
known O
from O
the O
voices O
of O
their O
representatives O
. O

Can O
any O
thing O
less O
than O
infinite O
wisdom O
elaborate O
a O
system O
more O
perfect O
than O
that O
which O
so O
effectually O
secures O
the O
happiness O
of O
every O
individual—which O
admits O
no O
law O
as O
obligatory O
but O
upon O
those O
who O
are O
expressly O
parties O
, O
or O
have O
actually O
subscribed O
to O
the O
obligation O
? O

If O
these O
be O
, O
as O
they O
certainly O
are O
, O
the O
well O
digested O
principles O
of O
the O
English O
constitution O
, O
with O
what O
appearance O
of O
reason O
can O
the O
warmest O
zealot O
for O
the O
superiority O
of O
Great-Britain B-Organization
assert O
, O
that O
the O
legislative O
power O
of O
parliament B-Organization
is O
sovereign O
and O
supreme O
? O

Shall O
the O
freemen O
of O
New-York B-Location
be O
reduced O
to O
a O
state O
of O
subordination O
, O
and O
deprived O
of O
those O
invaluable O
privileges O
enjoyed O
by O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
that O
city O
, O
which O
has O
given O
a O
name O
to O
their O
province B-Location
, O
because O
they O
are O
unfortunately O
placed O
a O
thousand O
leagues O
further O
from O
the O
presence O
of O
their O
sovereign O
; O
and O
, O
instead O
of O
prefering O
their O
petitions O
immediately O
to O
the O
royal O
ear O
, O
can O
only O
apply O
to O
his O
deputy O
for O
a O
redress O
of O
their O
grievances O
, O
and O
for O
the O
framing O
such O
regulations O
as O
the O
infant O
state O
of O
the O
colony O
may O
require O
? O

This O
would O
be O
heightening O
the O
misfortune O
of O
their O
situation O
by O
the O
most O
flagrant O
injustice O
. O

When O
the O
emigrants O
from O
Great-Britain B-Location
crossed O
the O
Atlantic B-Location
to O
settle O
the O
desarts O
of O
America B-Location
, O
they O
brought O
with O
them O
the O
spirit O
of O
the O
English B-Organization
government I-Organization
. O

They O
brought O
with O
them O
the O
same O
duties O
to O
their O
sovereign O
which O
the O
freemen O
of O
England B-Location
at O
that O
time O
acknowledged O
; O
and O
they O
very O
naturally O
supposed O
, O
that O
, O
under O
his O
direction O
, O
they O
should O
be O
allowed O
to O
make O
such O
regulations O
as O
might O
answer O
the O
purposes O
of O
their O
emigration O
. O

Ever O
mindful O
of O
their O
duty O
and O
allegiance O
to O
their O
Prince B-Organization
, O
they O
cannot O
easily O
conceive O
that O
they O
left O
their O
brethren O
the O
freemen O
of O
England B-Location
vested O
with O
a O
sovereign O
, O
supreme O
power O
to O
restrain O
their O
natural O
Liberty O
, O
4 O
or O
to O
dispose O
of O
their O
acquired O
property O
. O

Removed O
at O
an O
immense O
distance O
from O
the O
seat O
of O
government B-Organization
, O
they O
could O
no O
longer O
join O
the O
national B-Organization
council I-Organization
; O
but O
, O
as O
the O
very O
spirit O
of O
the O
English O
constitution O
required O
it O
, O
they O
naturally O
applied O
to O
their O
Prince O
for O
such O
protection O
and O
assistance O
, O
as O
might O
raise O
them O
to O
an O
equality O
with O
their O
brethren O
of O
England B-Location
; O
from O
whom O
they O
only O
requested O
their O
friendly O
patronage O
, O
during O
the O
weakness O
of O
their O
infant O
state O
. O

The O
formula O
of O
their O
government O
once O
settled O
in O
some O
measure O
to O
their O
satisfaction O
, O
with O
the O
concurrence O
of O
those O
officers O
appointed O
by O
the O
Crown B-Organization
, O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
these O
new O
settlements O
, O
ever O
faithfully O
preserving O
in O
their O
memory O
the O
principles O
of O
that O
happy O
government O
which O
they O
had O
just O
quitted O
, O
totally O
disclaim O
all O
subordination5 O
to O
, O
and O
dependence O
upon O
, O
the O
two O
inferior O
estates O
of O
their O
mother B-Organization

Without O
the O
power—without O
the O
inclination O
to O
disturb O
the O
tranquility O
of O
those O
to O
whom O
they O
stand O
so O
nearly O
related O
, O
they O
wish O
to O
promote O
an O
amicable O
intercourse O
, O
founded O
upon O
reciprocal O
interest O
; O
without O
allowing O
or O
submitting O
to O
any O
laws O
, O
but O
those O
which O
they O
themselves O
have O
made O
, O
by O
regular O
agreement O
with O
the O
deputy O
of O
the O
Crown B-Organization
, O
properly O
authorized O
for O
that O
purpose O
. O

To O
suppose O
the O
British B-Organization
parliament I-Organization
to O
be O
vested O
with O
a O
sovereign O
and O
supreme O
legislative O
power O
over O
the O
colonies B-Organization
, O
is O
advancing O
a O
supposition O
inconsistent O
with O
the O
principles O
of O
their O
own O
constitution O
; O
and O
to O
assert O
the O
necessity O
of O
subordination O
from O
the O
nature O
of O
our O
situation O
, O
without O
attempting O
to O
prove O
that O
necessity O
, O
is O
really O
treating O
an O
affair O
of O
the O
utmost O
importance O
with O
too O
little O
attention O
.6 O
Those O
who O
may O
probably O
be O
most O
seriously O
affected O
by O
this O
doctrine O
, O
very O
naturally O
require O
something O
stronger O
than O
general O
assertions O
to O
support O
it O
, O
although O
those O
assertions O
may O
be O
advanced O
by O
the O
best O
and O
wisest O
man O
of O
the O
nation B-Organization
. O

Perhaps O
it O
may O
not O
be O
such O
an O
irreconcileable O
paradox O
in O
policy O
to O
assert O
, O
that O
the O
freemen O
settled O
in O
America B-Location
may O
preserve O
themselves O
absolutely O
independant O
of O
their O
fellow O
subjects O
who O
more O
immediately O
surround O
the O
throne O

and O
yet O
discharge O
, O
with O
the O
strictest O
fidelity O
, O
all O
their O
duties O
to O
their O
sovereign O
. O

They O
may O
not O
only O
be O
loyal O
and O
valuable O
subjects O
to O
their O
Prince B-Organization
, O
but O
useful O
and O
necessary O
neighbours O
to O
their O
brethren O
of O
Britain B-Location
. O

The O
colonies O
may O
, O
with O
no O
great O
impropriety O
, O
be O
considered O
as O
so O
many O
different O
countries O
of O
the O
same O
kingdom B-Organization
, O
the O
nature O
of O
whose O
situation O
prevents O
their O
joining O
in O
the O
general B-Organization
council I-Organization
, O
and O
reduces O
them O
to O
a O
necessity O
of O
applying O
to O
their O
Prince O
for O
the O
establishment O
of O
such O
a O
partial O
policy O
as O
may O
be O
the O
best O
adapted O
to O
their O
particular O
circumstances O
, O
and O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
most O
conducive O
to O
the O
general O
good O
. O

That O
this O
partial O
policy O
, O
settled O
for O
every O
distinct O
part O
, O
may O
not O
interfere O
with O
the O
general O
welfare O
of O
the O
whole O
, O
the O
restraining O
power O
lodged O
in O
the O
Crown B-Organization
will O
always O
be O
able O
to O
insure O
; O
since O
we O
cannot O
suppose O
that O
a O
wise O
and O
just O
Prince O
would O
ever O
consent O
to O
sacrifice O
the O
interest O
and O
happiness O
of O
any O
one O
part O
to O
the O
selfish O
views O
of O
another O
. O

As O
a O
commercial O
people O

while O
blessed O
with O
the O
same O
advantages O
which O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
Great-Britain B-Location
enjoy O
, O
our O
interest O
may O
sometimes O
clash O
with O
theirs O
. O

This O
is O
an O
inconvenience O
which O
may O
, O
at O
some O
future O
period O
happen O
, O
in O
the O
extent O

this O

a O
sufficient O

Shall O
we O
be O
reduced O

the O
most O

because O
we O
may O
possibly O

The O
power O
of O

given O
up O
to O
their O
spirited O

the O
excess O
of O
their O
joy O
will O
not O
suffer O
them O
to O
indulge O
any O
gloomy O
reflections O
upon O
that O
dangerous O
reserve O
of O

. O

The O
present O
evil O
averted O

the O
warmth O
of O
their O
sanguine O
dispositions O
will O
not O
allow O
them O
to O
think O
that O
oppression O
may O
return O
at O
any O

time O

in O
any O

Their O
very O
gratitude O

prevent O
their O
enquiring O
into O
a O
cause O
of O
the O
last O
importance O
. O

In O
the O
highest O
exaltation O
of O
heart O
at O
a O
concession O
scarcely O
expected O
, O
they O
receive O
as O
a O
matter O
of O

what O
they O
demanded O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
right O
; O
and O
, O
to O
avoid O
an O
appearance O
of O
arrogance O
in O
urging O
any O

, O
they O
neglect O
the O
discharge O
of O
the O
most O
essential O
duties O
to O

Perhaps O
they O
will O
scarcely O
thank O
the O
man O
who O
shall O
endeavour O
to O
convince O
them O
, O
that O
the O
simple O
power O

as O
effectually O
ruin O

that O

in O

Mr O

Pitt B-Person
has O
indeed O
treated O
this O
opinion O
with O
so O
little O
attention O
, O
that O
he O
has O
only O
answered O
it O
by O
a O
general O
assertion O
— O
“ O
that O
there O
is O
a O
plain O
distinction O
between O

of O

and O

Plain O
as O
this O
distinction O
is O
, O
my O
most O
industrious O
enquiries O
have O
not O
yet O
led O
me O
to O
it O
; O
and O
I O
cannot O
but O
think O
with O
Mr O

, O
that O
they O
are O
the O

in O

— O
The O
one O
is O
precisely O
determined O
, O
while O
the O
other O
is O
more O
uncertain O
and O
eventual O
; O
but O
, O
in O
proportion O
to O
the O
sum O
raised O
, O
the O
effect O
will O
be O
exactly O
the O
same O
. O

It O
is O
taken O
for O
granted O
that O
the O
collection O
of O
a O
stamp O
duty O
would O
drain O
us O
of O
all O
the O
specie O
which O
we O
receive O
as O
a O
ballance O
in O
our O
West-India O
trade O
. O

If O
an O
exorbitant O
duty O
laid O
upon O
sugar O
and O
molasses O
produces O
the O
same O
effect O
, O
in O
what O
does O
the O
difference O
consist O
? O

By O
either O
means O
the O
treasury O
of O

will O
be O
enriched O
with O
the O
whole O
profit O
of O
our O

and O
we O
ourselves O
shall O
be O
reduced O
to O
that O
deplorable O
state O
of O
poverty O
, O
of O
which O
we O
have O
, O
at O
this O
very O
moment O
, O
a O
most O
affecting O
instance O

General O
as O
the O
calamity O
is O
now O

, O
there O
are O
few O
so O
uninformed O
as O
not O
to O
know O
that O
the O

of O

has O
done O
all O
this O
mischief O
, O
without O
any O
assistance O
from O
that O
of O

The O
severe O
restrictions O

made O

As O
great O
an O
enemy O
as O

may O
be O
to O

he O
has O
at O

kindly O
bestowed O
upon O

the O
most O
irrefragable O
proof O
that O

that O

may O
be O
as O
effectually O
ruined O
by O
the O
powers O
of O

as O
by O
those O
of O

When O
the O

of I-Organization
Great-Britain I-Organization
arrogate O
to O
themselves O
this O
sovereign O
jurisdiction O
over O
the O
colonies B-Organization

I O
should O
be O
glad O
to O
know O
on O
what O
principles O
they O
found O
their O

. O

Do O
they O
ground O
their O

on O
the O
excellent O
principles O
of O
their O

, O
or O
is O
this O
supremacy O
a O
power O
virtually O
inherent O
in O
the O
name O
of O
parliament B-Organization
? O

A O
name O
which O
should O
remind O
them O
of O
their O
original O
state O
of O
humility O
, O
when O
the O
distinguishing O
power O
which O
they O
boasted O
was O
a O
privilege O
of O
speaking O
their O
mind O
and O
remonstrating O
their O
grievances O
. O

The O
Lords B-Organization
indeed O
may O
, O
with O
some O
appearance O
of O
reason O
, O
assert O
a O
supreme O
jurisdiction O
over O
the O
whole O
body O
of O
the O
nation B-Organization
, O
as O
the O
highest O
court O
of O
judicature O
: O
But O
when O
an O
aspiring O
member O
of O
the O
Commons B-Organization
House I-Organization
confidently O
declares O
that O
he O
has O
a O
power O
to O
bind O
our O
trade O
, O
and O
restrain O
our O
manufactures O
, O
I O
should O
be O
glad O
to O
know O
whether O
he O
derived O
this O
power O
from O
the O
honest O
freemen O
his O
constituents O
, O
or O
whether O
he O
acquired O
it O
by O
virtue O
of O
his O
office O
? O

From O
his O
constituents O
he O
could O
receive O
no O
more O
power O
than O
they O
naturally O
possessed O
; O
and O
, O
from O
his O
office O
he O
cannot O
reasonably O
be O
supposed O
vested O
with O
any O
other O
authority O
, O
than O
that O
of O
deciding O
upon O
the O
formalities O
, O
and O
punctilios O
annexed O
to O
it O
. O

To O
grasp O
at O
a O
jurisdiction O
so O
infinitely O
extensive O
, O
and O
so O
little O
capable O
of O
limitation O
, O
is O
expressly O
declaring O
, O
that O
, O
from O
the O
antiquity O
of O
their O
establishment O
, O
they O
are O
become O
sovereigns O
of O
the O
new-discovered O
world O
. O

Upon O
some O
such O
arbitrary O
principles O
must O
they O
ground O
their O
unreasonable O
pretensions O
; O
since O
no O
man O
in O
his O
senses O
will O
assert O
that O
an O
inhabitant O
of O
Birmingham B-Location
or O
Manchester B-Location
has O
a O
natural O
right O
, O
after O
having O
obtained O
the O
consent O
of O
the O
Crown B-Organization
, O
to O
restrain O
, O
and O
prevent O
an O
industrious O
settler O
of O
the O
colonies B-Organization
from O
engaging O
in O
those O
particular O
manufactures O
which O
may O
interfere O
with O
the O
business O
of O
his O
own O
profession O
. O

Absurd O
as O
this O
assertion O
is O
, O
either O
this O
must O
be O
maintained O
, O
or O
one O
full O
as O
pregnant O
with O
absurdity O
; O
since O
one O
may O
with O
as O
much O
reason O
suppose O
this O
natural O
superiority O
in O
the O
freemen O
of O
Great-Britain B-Location
, O
as O
this O
acquired O
sovereignty O
in O
the O
collective B-Organization
body I-Organization
of I-Organization
their I-Organization
representatives I-Organization
. O

Whatever O
reasons O
they O
may O
devise O
to O
support O
this O
extraordinary O
claim O
, O
the O
motives O
to O
their O
usurpation O
are O
clearly O
evinced O
in O
that O
part O
of O
Mr O

’ O

where O

A O

we O
may O

in O
some O

has O
urged O
them O
to O
exercise O
a O
piece O
of O
Ottoman O
policy O
, O
by O
strangling O
us O
in O
our O
infancy O
. O

When O
we O
examine O
into O
the O
nature O
of O
those O
fears O
which O
have O
already O
proved O
so O
fatal O
to O
our O
interest O
, O
the O
slightest O
examination O
shews O
them O
as O
contemptible O
and O
ill-grounded O
as O
were O
ever O
entertained O
by O
the O
most O
selfish O
of O
mankind O
. O

Had O
not O
this O
refined O
policy O
of O
our O
British B-Person
Machiavel I-Person
interfered O
, O
and O
roused O
us O
to O
attention O
, O
we O
should O
, O
in O
all O
human O
probability O
, O
have O
continued O
for O
many O
centuries O
the O
faithful O
drudges O
of O
our O
indulgent B-Organization
mother I-Organization
; O
and O
GreatBritain B-Organization
would O
have O
increased O
in O
strength O
and O
riches O
in O
proportion O
to O
the O
population O
of O
her O
colonies B-Organization
. O

While O
our O
commerce O
continued O
unrestrained O
we O
should O
industriously O
have O
cultivated O
every O
branch O
of O
it O
, O
that O
we O
might O
be O
enabled O
to O
pay O
punctually O
to O
Great-Britain B-Organization
, O
that O
ballance O
which O
would O
every O
year O
increase O
; O
since O
our O
attention O
to O
the O
settling O
an O
immeasureable O
extent O
of O
country B-Organization
would O
effectually O
prevent O
our O
establishing O
such O
manufactories O
as O
would O
furnish O
us O
with O
the O
necessaries O
of O
life O
. O

Had O
I O
sufficient O
information O
to O
enter O
into O
a O
minute O
detail O
of O
facts O
, O
I O
believe O
it O
would O
be O
no O
difficult O
matter O
to O
prove O
, O
that O
, O
in O
the O
course O
of O
our O
most O
successful O
commerce O
, O
Great-Britain B-Organization
receives O
nine-tenths O
of O
the O
profit O
; O
whilst O
we O
are O
humbly O
contented O
with O
being O
well O
fed O
and O
cloathed O
as O
the O
wages O
of O
our O
labour O
. O

If O
this O
inferiority O
be O
the O
consequence O
of O
a O
reasonable O
connection O
, O
why O
would O
they O
wish O
to O
reduce O
us O
to O
a O
state O
of O
abject O
dependence O
? O

Or O
, O
if O
with O
the O
advantages O
which O
they O
already O
possess O
, O
a O
fair O
unlimited O
trade O
would O
bring O
into O
their O
hands O
all O
the O
specie O
which O
we O
could O
draw O
from O
the O
West-Indies B-Location
, O
why O
would O
they O
wantonly O
use O
such O
detestable O
measures O
as O
they O
have O
lately O
pursued O
, O
to O
effect O
the O

purpose O
? O

If O
the O
present O
severe O
system O
of O

be O
the O
result O
of O
unreasonable O
jealousy O
, O
I O
will O
venture O
to O
assert O
that O
this O
very O
policy O
will O
counteract O
its O
own O
intention O
. O

Their O
distresses O
first O
led O
the O
colonists O
into O
enquiries O
concerning O
the O
nature O
of O
their O
political O
situation O
, O
and O
the O
justice O
of O
the O
treatment O
which O
they O
had O
received O
. O

That O
ignorance O
which O
had O
kept O
them O
in O
a O
state O
of O
peaceable O
submission O
fled O
before O
their O
eager O
researches O
after O
that O
information O
which O
was O
so O
essentially O
necessary O
to O
the O
preservation O
of O
their O
liberty O
. O

Enraged O
to O
find O
, O
that O
, O
while O
they O
had O
been O
amused O
with O
the O
specious O
title O
of O
fellow O
subjects O
, O
and O
flattered O
with O
the O
rights O
of O
British O
freemen O
, O
they O
were O
in O
reality O
treated O
as O
infants O
in O
policy O
, O
whose O
every O
motion O
was O
to O
be O
directed O
by O
the O
arbitrary O
will O
of O
their O
jealous O
parent O
; O
when O
every O
such O
direction O
evidently O
tended O
to O
reduce O
the O
one O
to O
an O
abject O
state O
of O
dependence O
, O
and O
to O
raise O
the O
other O
to O
the O
most O
exalted O
superiority O
. O

That O
both O
these O
purposes O
could O
easily O
have O
been O
obtained O
, O
by O
measures O
artfully O
managed O
, O
is O
not O
to O
be O
doubted O
, O
since O
nothing O
but O
the O
most O
violent O
oppression O
could O
have O
roused O
us O
from O
our O
state O
of O
stupefaction O
to O
a O
proper O
degree O
of O
attention O
. O

But O
when O
our O
sensibility O
was O
excited O
by O
the O
most O
pointed O
injustice O
, O
rage O
instantly O
succeeded O
that O
tranquility O
which O
had O
been O
nourished O
by O
our O
imaginary O
security O
. O

Warmed O
with O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
injuries O
which O
we O
suffered O
, O
neither O
our O
gratitude O
nor O
our O
fear O
could O
prevent O
our O
asserting O
those O
rights O
, O
the O
possession O
of O
which O
can O
alone O
determine O
us O
freemen O
; O
and O
, O
though O
we O
could O
not O
but O
see O
that O
superiority O
of O
power O
which O
could O
“ O
crush O
us O
to O
atoms O
” O
yet O
could O
we O
have O
found O
even O
in O
the O
modern O
history O
of O

so O
many O
examples O
for O
our O
encouragement O

that O
we O
should O
not O

to O
preserve O

THE O
advocates O
for O
the O

of O

enumerate O
amongst O
the O
other O
obligations O
by O
which O
we O
are O

the O
favours O
which O
she O
has O
constantly O
conferred O
, O
and O
the O
support O
which O
we O
have O
continually O
received O

If O
we O
could O
reasonably O
suppose O
a O
whole O
political O

, O
actuated O
by O
the O

passions O
which O
may O
influence O
an O
individual O
, O
then O
, O
indeed O
there O
would O
be O
some O
foundation O
for O
our O
grateful O
acknowledgements O
; O
but O
when O
we O
plainly O
perceive O
that O
the O
bounties O
which O
Great-Britain B-Organization
is O
said O
so O
lavishly O
to O
have O
bestowed O
upon O
us O
, O
are O
meted O
out O
in O
the O
common O
political O
measure O
, O
with O
an O
evident O
intention O
finally O
to O
promote O
her O
own O

, O
we O
can O
only O
say O
that O
her O
actions O
are O
the O
result O
of O
good O
policy O
not O
of O
great O
generosity O

As O
for O
the O

which O
they O
have O
given O
us O
in O
times O
of O
danger O
, O
if O
it O
did O
not O
immediately O
arise O
from O
the O

motive O
which O
has O
produced O
their O
other O
favours O
, O
I O
am O
still O
amazed O
that O
it O
should O
be O
even O
mentioned O
by O
those O
who O
have O
lavished O

much O

for O
the O

of O
an O

in O

those O
who O
never O

them O

The O
most O

must O
serve O
to O
convince O

that O

Great-Britain B-Organization
could O
no O
where O
have O
been O
fought O
with O
so O
much O
advantage O
as O
in O
the O
woods B-Location
of I-Location
America I-Location
; O
where O
her O
troops O
could O
be O
supplied O
with O
all O
the O
necessaries O
of O
life O
upon O
the O
easiest O
terms O
, O
and O
from O
whence O
all O
the O
money O
which O
they O
expended O
immediately O
returned O
in O
immense O
payments O
for O
the O
extraordinary O
importations O
of O
her O
manufactures O
which O
the O
exigencies O
of O
the O
war O
required O
. O

Thus O
were O
the O
whole O
expences O
of O
the O
American O
war O
very O
far O
from O
lessening O
the O
strength O
or O
riches O
of O
the O
nation B-Organization
; O
while O
her O
forces O
, O
which O
were O
not O
sufficient O
to O
make O
any O
considerable O
impression O
upon O
the O
body O
of O
her O
natural O
enemy O
, O
were O
enabled O
to O
lop O
off O
one O
of O
its O
most O
valuable O
limbs O
. O

In O
effecting O
this O
glorious O
purpose O
, O
I O
will O
venture O
to O
mention O
the O
assistance O
which O
they O
received O
from O
the O
provincial O
troops O
as O
an O
aid O
of O
more O
importance O
than O
is O
generally O
allowed O
. O

I O
will O
even O
take O
the O
liberty O
to O
assert O
, O
that O
the O
colonists O
, O
in O
proportion O
to O
their O
real O
ability O
, O
did O
more O
for O
the O
general O
cause O
than O
could O
reasonably O
have O
been O
expected O
, O
if O
not O
more O
than O
Great-Britain B-Organization
herself O
. O

This O
assertion O
I O
fancy O
will O
gain O
more O
credit O
now O
than O
it O
would O
have O
gained O
some O
time O
ago O
; O
since O
the O
eyes O
of O
the O
world O
are O
at O
last O
open O
, O
and O
they O
must O
, O
if O
they O
are O
not O
wilfully O
blind O
, O
plainly O
discover O
, O
that O
the O
estimates O
of O
our O
wealth O
which O
have O
been O
received O
from O
ignorant O
or O
prejudiced O
persons O
, O
are O
, O
in O
every O
calculation O
, O
grossly O
erroneous O
. O

These O
misrepresentations O
, O
which O
have O
been O
so O
industriously O
propagated O
, O
are O
very O
possibly O
the O
offspring O
of O
political O
invention O
, O
as O
they O
form O
the O
best O
apology O
for O
imposing O
upon O
us O
burthens O
to O
which O
we O
are O
altogether O
unequal O
. O

The O
easy O
faith O
which O
every O
absurd O
information O
obtained O
, O
and O
the O
precipitate O
measures O
, O
which O
were O
the O
consequence O
of O
this O
unreasonable O
credulity O
, O
must O
sufficiently O
convince O
us O
, O
that O
while O
we O
are O
within O
the O
reach O
of O
parliamentary O
power O
, O
we O
shall O
not O
be O
suffered O
to O
riot O
in O
a O
superfluity O
of O
wealth O
, O
or O
to O
acquire O
any O
dangerous O
degree O
of O
strength O
. O

Whatever O
advantages O
may O
hereafter O
present O
themselves O
, O
from O
an O
increased O
population O
, O
or O
a O
more O
extended O
trade O
, O
we O
shall O
never O
be O
able O
to O
cultivate O
them O
to O
any O
valuable O
purpose O
; O
for O
, O
howmuch O
soever O
we O
may O
possess O
the O
ability O
of O
acquiring O
wealth O
and O
independence O
, O
the O
partial O
views O
of O
our O
selfish O
brethren O
, O
supported O
by O
the O
sovereignty O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
, O
will O
most O
effectually O
prevent O
our O
enjoying O
such O
invaluable O
acquisitions O
. O

If O
any O
alteration O
in O
our O
system O
of O
agriculture O
, O
should O
furnish O
us O
with O
a O
sufficiency O
of O
the O
necessary O
articles O
for O
the O
establishment O
of O
the O
most O
valuable O
manufactories O
, O
and O
an O
increase O
of O
population O
should O
enable O
us O
to O
carry O
them O
on O
to O
the O
greatest O
advantage O
, O
the O
manufacturers O
of O
Great-Britain B-Location
, O
jealous O
of O
such O
a O
formidable O
encroachment O
, O
would O
easily O
obtain O
the O
interposition O
of O
our O
sovereign O
directors O
; O
who O
would O
very O
naturally O
ordain O
, O
that O
we O
should O
export O
our O
unwrought O
materials O
to O
be O
laboured O
by O
our O
more O
skillful O
brethren O
, O
and O
dispatch O
our O
superfluous O
inhabitants O
in O
search O
of O
another O
vacant O
world O
: O
And O
, O
if O
the O
extent O
of O
our O

should O
draw O
into O
our O
hands O
the O
wealth O
of O
all O
the O
Indies O

the O

unlimitted O

would O
always O
carefully O
provide O
ways O

for O
conveying O
the O

as O

The O
measures O
which O
have O
already O
been O
pursued O
almost O
give O
to O
conjecture O
the O
force O
of O
conviction O
; O
since O
no O
man O
can O
have O
been O
so O
inattentive O
to O
the O
most O
interesting O
facts O
as O
not O
to O
know O
that O
the O
power O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
, O
exerted O
in O
the O
single O
instance O
of O
restraining O
our O
trade O
, O
has O
already O
reduced O
us O
to O
inconceivable O
distress O
. O

Denied O
the O
means O
of O
acquiring O
specie O
sufficient O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O
a O
general O
circulation O
, O
and O
limitted O
in O
the O
emission O
of O
our O
paper O
currency O
, O
men O
of O
considerable O
real O
estates O
become O
unable O
to O
answer O
the O
most O
trifling O
demands O
; O
and O
, O
when O
urged O
by O
creditors O
, O
perhaps O
as O
much O
perplexed O
as O
themselves O
, O
their O
lands O
are O
sold O
by O
execution O
for O
less O
than O
half O
their O
former O
value O
. O

This O
, O
as O
one O
of O
the O
most O
striking O
inconveniences O
, O
attending O
the O
late O
unseasonable O
exertion O
of O
parliamentary O
power O
, O
I O
have O
selected O
for O
observation O
, O
from O
a O
very O
extensive O
catalogue O
of O
grievances O
which O
it O
has O
already O
produced O
, O
and O
of O
which O
we O
are O
at O
this O
moment O
most O
severely O
sensible O
. O

I O
am O
led O
to O
my O
choice O
of O
this O
particular O
fact O
from O
a O
consideration O
of O
the O
fatal O
consequence O
by O
which O
it O
may O
possibly O
be O
attended O
, O
should O
the O
merchants O
of O
England B-Location
immediately O
demand O
a O
rigid O
payment O
of O
the O
general O
ballance O
due O
to O
them O
. O

It O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
matter O
to O
conceive O
how O
much O
our O
property O
may O
be O
affected O
by O
so O
unseasonable O
a O
demand O
; O
since O
the O
calamity O
would O
, O
by O
a O
regular O
connection O
, O
extend O
from O
the O
lowest O
to O
the O
highest O
member O
of O
society O
. O

But O
, O
as O
it O
was O
never O
my O
intention O
to O
enter O
into O
a O
minute O
detail O
of O
facts O
, O
I O
shall O
content O
myself O
with O
offering O
such O
loose O
, O
desultory O
observations O
as O
may O
serve O
to O
direct O
others O
in O
their O
researches O
after O
more O
particular O
information O
upon O
the O
most O
interesting O
subject O
. O

In O
the O
further O
pursuit O
of O
this O
design O
, O
I O
shall O
just O
take O
the O
liberty O
to O
observe O
upon O
the O
resolves O
of O
the O
Commons B-Organization
, O
of O
February O
1766 O
; O
that O
the O
severe O
censures O
which O
they O
so O
liberally O
bestow O
upon O
us O
, O
are O
evidently O
inconsistent O
with O
the O
principles O
upon O
which O
they O
are O
supposed O
to O
have O
voted O
the O
repeal O
of O
the O
Stamp-act O
. O

From O
these O
resolves O
we O
may O
very O
reasonably O
suppose O
that O
the O
repeal O
is O
more O
immediately O
founded O
upon O
the O
inexpediency O
of O
the O
act O
, O
than O
upon O
a O
conviction O
that O
they O
had O
exerted O
an O
unconstitutional O
power O
. O

Had O
they O
been O
willing O
to O
allow O
this O
act O
as O
invasive O
of O
an O
indisputable O
right O
, O
they O
would O
not O
so O
severely O
have O
censured O
us O
for O
our O
daring O
opposition O
, O
and O
lavished O
such O
praises O
upon O
those O
whose O
selfish O
views O
or O
slavish O
principles O
made O
them O
so O
readily O
subscribe O
to O
the O
infalibility O
and O
omnipotence O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
. O

— O
A O
peaceable O
submission O
to O
the O
first O
attacks O
of O
encroaching O
power O
, O
is O
altogether O
incompatible O
with O
the O
genius O
of O
liberty O
; O
nor O
could O
it O
reasonably O
be O
expected O
, O
that O
, O
in O
such O
a O
sudden O
and O
dangerous O
invasion O
of O
our O
most O
estimable O
rights O
, O
the O
form O
of O
opposition O
could O
be O
perfectly O
model O
’ O
d O
by O
the O
hand O
of O
prudence O
. O

Violent O
and O
precipitate O
as O
our O
measures O
were O
, O
they O
wanted O
nothing O
but O
success O
to O
sanctify O
them O
; O
since O
the O
most O
superficial O
observer O
cannot O
but O
have O
discovered O
, O
that O
, O
in O
the O
political O
world O
right O
and O
wrong O
are O
merely O
arbitrary O
modes O
totally O
dependent O
upon O
the O
rise O
and O
fall O
of O
contending O
parties O
. O

The O
people O
of O
England B-Location
very O
justly O
dissatisfied O
with O
the O
tyrannic O
conduct O
of O
a O
weak O
prince B-Person
, O
made O
the O
boldest O
struggles O
for O
the O
support O
of O
their O
languishing O
liberty O
. O

In O
their O
first O
ill-directed O
efforts O
under O
the O
unfortunate O
Monmouth B-Person
, O
the O
justice O
of O
their O
cause O
could O
not O
save O
them O
from O
the O
pains O
and O
penalties O
of O
open O
rebellion O
: O
But O
when O
a O
Prince O
of O
military O
abilities O
gave O
them O
his O
powerful O
assistance O
, O
they O
suddenly O
effected O
the O
preservation O
of O
their O
freedom O
and O
distinguished O
so O
important O
an O
event O
by O
the O
title O
of O
a O
glorious O
revolution O
; O
so O
much O
influence O
has O
success O
in O
rating O
the O
merit O
of O
our O
political O
conduct O
. O

When O
the O
Committee B-Organization
of I-Organization
the I-Organization
House I-Organization
resolve O
, O
in O
the O
most O
general O
and O
expressive O
terms O
, O
that O
the O
authority O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
over O
the O
colonies B-Organization
is O
sovereign O
and O
supreme O
in O
every O
respect O
whatever O
, O
there O
is O
no O
reasoning O
against O
so O
formidable O
a O
resolution O
, O
supported O
by O
the O
power O
of O
the O
whole O
Kingdom B-Organization
. O

We O
can O
only O
remark O
that O
the O
same O
house O
has O
heretofore O
resolved O
to O
take O
under O
their O
own O
particular O
direction O
, O
the O
rights O
of O
the O
People O
, O
the O
privileges O
of O
the O
Lords B-Organization
, O
and O
the O
sovereignty O
of O
the O
Crown B-Organization
; O
and O
, O
for O
a O
long O
time O
maintained O
this O
unnatural O
usurpation O
. O

If O
they O
did O
not O
suffer O
the O
passions O
of O
the O
man O
to O
influence O
the O
judgement O
of O
the O
Senator O
, O
they O
would O
never O
treat O
that O
as O
a O
point O
of O
honour O
which O
should O
only O
be O
considered O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
right O
. O

If O
, O
upon O
a O
cool O
, O
dispassionate O
enquiry O
, O
it O
may O
appear O
that O
the O
Commons B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great-Britain I-Organization
, O
have O
no O
natural O
or O
acquired O
superiority O
over O
the O
freemen O
of O
America B-Location
, O
they O
will O
certainly O
do O
us O
the O
justice O
to O
acknowledge O
this O
very O
reasonable O
independence O
, O
and O
not O
wickedly O
endeavour O
to O
enslave O
millions O
to O
promote O
the O
honour O
and O
dignity O
of O
a O
few O
ambitious O
individuals O
. O

In O
supporting O
this O
doctrine O
of O
independence O
, O
I O
have O
established O
as O
an O
incontrovertible O
truth O
, O
this O
very O
accurate O
definition O
of O
my O
Lord O
C O
. O

J O
. O

Hale B-Person
— O
That O
every O
act O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
is O
a O
tripartite O
indenture O
of O
agreement O
between O
the O
three O
estates O
of O
the O
Kingdom B-Organization
. O

If O
this O
maxim O
be O
not O
disputable O
, O
I O
very O
humbly O
conceive O
that O
every O
consequence O
which O
I O
have O
drawn O
from O
it O
, O
is O
fairly O
and O
logically O
deduced O
; O
for O
it O
cannot O
, O
but O
with O
the O
most O
glaring O
absurdity O
, O
be O
supposed O
, O
that O
the O
parties O
to O
these O
political O
agreements O
may O
legally O
bind O
those O
who O
are O
not O
, O
in O
any O
wise O
privy O
to O
them O
. O

The O
very O
spirit O
of O
the O
English O
constitution O
requires O
, O
that O
general O
regulations O
framed O
for O
the O
government O
of O
society O
, O
must O
have O
the O
sanction O
of O
general O
approbation O
; O
and O
, O
that O
no O
man O
shall O
be O
deprived O
of O
life O
, O
liberty O
or O
property O
, O
but O
, O
by O
the O
force O
of O
those O
laws O
to O
which O
he O
has O
voluntarily O
subscribed O
. O

These O
principles O
once O
acknowledged O
as O
the O
foundation O
of O
English O
liberty O
, O
how O
can O
the O
colonists O
be O
said O
to O
possess O
the O
natural O
rights O
of O
mankind O
, O
or O
the O
peculiar O
privileges O
of O
Englishmen O
, O
while O
they O
are O
every O
day O
liable O
to O
receive O
laws O
framed O
by O
persons O
ignorant O
of O
their O
abilities O
— O
unacquainted O
with O
their O
necessities O
, O
and O
evidently O
influenced O
by O
partial O
motives O
? O

If O
my O
zeal O
for O
the O
good O
of O
my O
country B-Organization
has O
not O
greatly O
clouded O
my O
judgment O
, O
I O
still O
dare O
so O
far O
depend O
upon O
the O
principles O
which O
I O
have O
established O
, O
as O
to O
assert O
, O
that O
, O
while O
the O
power O
of O
the O
British B-Organization
Parliament I-Organization
is O
acknowledged O
Sovereign O
& O
supreme O
in O
every O
respect O
whatever O
, O
the O
liberty O
of O
America B-Organization
is O
no O
more O
than O
a O
flattering O
dream O
, O
and O
her O
privileges O
delusive O
shadows O
. O

While O
I O
relate O
matters O
of O

, O
from O
the O
best O
evidence O
which O
I O
am O
capable O
of O
receiving O
, O
if O
I O
have O
misrepresented O
them O
, O
I O
lie O
open O
to O
contradiction O
; O
and O
, O
when O
I O
recapitulate O
the O
principles O
from O
which O
I O
have O
drawn O
my O
train O
of O
reasoning O
, O
I O
am O
not O
so O
obstinately O
attached O
to O
my O
own O
opinion O
as O
to O
be O
proof O
against O
conviction O
. O

If O
I O
am O
guilty O
of O
any O
errors O
in O
the O
course O
of O
this O
unconnected O
performance O
, O
they O
must O
be O
attributed O
to O
my O
not O
having O
received O
sufficient O
information O
, O
or O
to O
my O
want O
of O
ability O
in O
using O
the O
materials O
which O
I O
had O
acquired O
. O

I O
have O
never O
wilfully O
misrepresented O
a O
fact O
, O
nor O
designedly O
drawn O
from O
it O
a O
falacious O
consequence O

I O
have O
not O
laboured O

system O

the O
vanity O

the O

be O

have O
as O
pernicious O
an O
effect O

upon O

which O
our O
enemies O
could O
wish O
to O

us O

It O
has O
repeatedly O
been O
alledged O
, O
that O
this O
restraining O
authority O
is O
essential O
to O
the O
welfare O
of O
Great-Britain B-Organization
—that O
it O
has O
grown O
up O
with O

colonies B-Organization
from O
their O
infancy O
, O
and O
is O
become O
a O
necessary O
ingredient O
in O
their O
constitution O

It O
is O
readily O
allowed O
that O
such O
a O
regulating O
power O
ought O
to O
be O
lodged O
somewhere O
, O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
whole O
community O
; O
but O
when O
we O
pay O
this O
attention O
due O
to O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
mother B-Organization

, O
let O
us O
not O
be O
shamefully O
negligent O
of O
our O
own O
preservation O
, O
by O
conceding O
such O
an O
extensive O
, O
unlimitted O
authority O
as O
may O
at O
any O
time O
be O
exercised O
to O
our O
own O
ruin O

Under O
a O
pretence O
of O
regulating O
our O
trade O
we O
may O
be O
stripped O
of O
our O
property O
; O
and O
with O
an O
appearance O
of O
limitting O
our O
manufactures O

we O
may O
insensibly O
be O
robbed O

our O
liberty O

To O
depend O
for O
the O
security O
of O
all O
that O
is O
valuable O
in O

upon O
that O

which O
all O
mankind O
have O
a O
right O
to O
make O
against O
acts O
of O
violence O

would O
be O
expecting O
relief O

a O
remedy O
which O
is O
too O
often O
worse O
than O
the O
disease O
itself O

There O
cannot O
indeed O
be O
a O
juster O
principle O
in O
all O

than O
that O
those O
who O
have O
received O
any O
delegated O

, O
are O
accountable O
to O
their O
constituents O
for O
any O
abuse O
of O
their O
trust O

But O
no O
man O
of O
common O
sense O
, O
can O
ever O
consider O
this O
dangerous O
resource O
as O
a O
sufficient O
security O
against O
all O
those O
mischiefs O
which O
so O
frequently O
attend O
the O
lodging O
an O
unlimitted O
authority O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
any O
individual O

This O
reservation O
, O
which O
is O
so O
reasonably O
implied O
in O
every O
social O
compact O
, O
should O
indeed O
never O
be O
totally O

Such O
is O
the O
weakness O

that O
in O

Our O

where O

very O
little O

us O
now O

to O

what O
has O
already O
been O
offered O
, O
to O
the O
purpose O
for O
which O
it O
was O
designed O
, O
and O
let O
us O
reduce O
the O
state O
of O
what O
we O
at O
present O
contend O
for O
, O
to O
the O
simplest O
position O
. O

Can O
we O

with O
any O
appearance O

, O
boldly O
deny O
to O
the O
parliament B-Organization
of I-Organization

a O
right O
to O
dispose O
of O
our O
acquired O
property O
, O
and O
yet O
tamely O
concede O
a O
power O
of O
restraining O
our O
natural O
liberty O

Can O
we O
explain O
this O
paradox O
to O
the O
apprehension O
of O
common O
sense O
? O

Or O
can O
we O
reconcile O
this O
conduct O
to O
the O
duty O
which O
we O
owe O
to O
ourselves O
and O
our O
posterity O
? O

Is O
wealth O
of O
more O
importance O
to O
us O
than O
freedom O
, O
or O
can O
we O
expect O
to O
enjoy O
the O
one O
when O
we O
have O
lost O
the O
other O
? O

Should O
we O
not O
, O
with O
great O
reason O
, O
laugh O
at O
the O
folly O
of O
that O
man O
, O
who O
might O
think O
to O
guard O
his O
domestic O
treasure O
against O
the O
invasions O
of O
the O
nightly O
robber O
, O
by O
carefully O
shutting O
up O
his O
windows O
, O
while O
his O
unshut O
doors O
offered O
him O
an O
easy O
passage O
? O

And O
would O
not O
this O
absurdity O
assume O
the O
face O
of O
madness O
, O
if O
, O
in O
pursuit O
of O
his O
extravagance O
, O
he O
should O
leave O
unguarded O
every O
passage O
to O
his O
wealth O
and O
person O
, O
depending O
altogether O
for O
their O
security O
upon O
that O
opposition O
which O
he O
might O
justly O
make O
to O
any O
such O
illegal O
attack O
? O

Exposed O
to O
artifice O
which O
he O
might O
never O
detect O
, O
or O
invaded O
by O
a O
power O
which O
he O
might O
be O
unable O
to O
resist O
, O
we O
should O
very O
reasonably O
expect O
that O
he O
would O
fall O
a O
sacrifice O
to O
his O
own O
extravagant O
presumption O
. O

It O
has O
been O
urged O
that O
this O
power O
of O
regulating O
and O
restraining O
our O
trade O
, O
has O
grown O
up O
with O
the O
colonies B-Location
, O
and O
is O
become O
a O
part O
of O
their O
constitution O
. O

This O
argument O
can O
prove O
nothing O
, O
because O
it O
proves O
too O
much O
; O
since O
the O
same O
mode O
of O
reasoning O
will O
sanctify O
all O
those O
encroachments O
upon O
our O
liberty O
which O
have O
from O
time O
to O
time O
been O
made O
by O
the O
lawless O
power O
of O
a O
wicked O
minister O
, O
or O
by O
the O
envious O
partiality O
of O
a O
jealous O
Parliament O
. O

Incapable O
of O
framing O
laws O
for O
our O
own O
government O
, O
we O
willingly O
received O
them O
from O
the O
hands O
of O
others O
; O
and O
too O
weak O
to O
contend O
, O
we O
patiently O
submitted O
to O
a O
power O
which O
we O
could O
not O
resist O
: O
But O
this O
conduct O
, O
which O
was O
the O
result O
of O
an O
over O
ruling O
necessity O
, O
can O
never O
, O
with O
any O
degree O
of O
propriety O
, O
be O
urged O
against O
our O
present O
endeavours O
to O
resume O
and O
secure O
the O
rights O
and O
privileges O
of O
British O
subjects O

When O
we O
come O
to O
take O
a O
review O
of O
that O
variant O

inconsistent O
form O
of O

which O
we O
have O
receiv O

different O
periods O

but O
discover O
numberless O
deficiencies O
; O

not O
barely O
defects O
in O
form O
, O
but O
such O
imperfections O
as O
must O
inevitably O
destroy O
the O
very O
basis O
of O

Alarm O
’ O
d O
with O
this O
discovery O

do O
we O
not O
very O
reasonably O
require O
that O
the O
constitution O
of O
the O

should O
be O
regulated O
by O
that O
most O
excellent O
model O
which O
has O
been O
approved O
by O
the O
greatest O

The O
King B-Organization

is O

and O
he O
may O

Why O
then O
are O
we O
denied O
that O
protection O
to O
which O
every O
subject O
is O
entitled O
? O

Or O
why O
are O
the O
liberties O

fortunate O

to O
be O
guarded O
by O
every O
precaution O
which O
their O

powers O

With O
a O

so O
imperfect O

have O
ever O

exerted O
themselves O
to O
guard O

the O
most O
distant O

They O
have O
gone O
so O
far O
as O
to O
consider O
the O
power O
of O
creating O
any O
additional O
number O
of O

as O
a O
dangerous O
prerogative O
