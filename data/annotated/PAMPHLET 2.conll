was O
royal O
governor B-Organization

Massachusetts I-Organization
Bay O
from O
1760 O
to O
1769 O
, O
and O
for O
many O
American O
colonists O
he O
would O
come O
to O
symbolize O
much O
that O
was O
wrong O
with O
the O
governance B-Organization
of I-Organization

British I-Organization
Empire I-Organization

Although O
Bernard B-Person
did O
not O
publish O
the O
ninety-seven O

for O
the O
empire O
that O
follows O
until O
1774 O
in O
London B-Organization

he O
actually O
wrote O
it O
in O
1764 O

in O
Boston B-Location

At O
that O
time O
he O
had O
a O
few O
copies O

in O
the O
provincial B-Location

which O
he O
sent O
for O
their O

Bernard B-Person
’ O

the O
kinds O

that O

long O
been O
circulating O
among O
second-level O
bureaucrats O

With O
British O
politics O
in O
the O
1760s O
in O
disarray O
, O
as O
ministries B-Organization
rose O

fell O
one O
after O
another O
, O
much O
of O
what O
stability O
existed O
in O
the O
British B-Organization
government I-Organization
came O
from O
such O
undersecretaries O

sub-ministers O
as O
Thomas B-Person
Whately I-Person
, O
secretary B-Organization

Not O
only O
did O
the O
relative O
permanence O
of O
these O
second-level O

mark O
the O
beginnings O
of O
a O
modern O
British B-Organization
civil I-Organization

their O
steady O
presence O
in O
the O

gave O
what O
evenness O
there O
was O
to O
the O

of O
the O
imperial O
reforms O
in O
the O
1760s O
and O
1770s O

These O
bureaucrats O
often O
had O
a O
clearer O
sense O
of O
the O
problems O
facing O
imperial O
administrators O
in O
America B-Location
than O
did O
their O
political O
superiors O
in O
the O
privy B-Organization

, O
and O
, O
like O
Bernard B-Person

they O
had O
very O
definite O
ideas O

PREFACE O
IN O
THE O
YEAR O
1764 O
. O

A O
VIEW O
of O
the O
present O
wealth O
, O
power O
, O
and O
extension O
of O
the O
British B-Organization
Empire I-Organization
is O
alarming O
as O
well O
as O
pleasing O
: O
we O
cannot O
but O
be O
concerned O
for O
the O
stability O
of O
a O
fabrick O
built O
on O
so O
disjoined O
foundations O
, O
and O
raised O
to O
so O
great O
a O
heighth O
; O
and O
must O
be O
convinced O
that O
it O
will O
require O
much O
political O
skill O
to O
secure O
its O
duration O
. O

The O
most O
obvious O
means O
to O
effect O
this O
, O
must O
be O
an O
Union O
of O
the O
several O
parts O
of O
this O
vast O
body O
, O
and O
especially O
a O
Connection O
between O
the O
Seat B-Organization
of I-Organization
Empire I-Organization
and O
its O
Dependencies B-Organization
; O
a O
Connection O
not O
created O
by O
temporary O
expedients O
, O
or O
supported O
by O
enforced O
subjection O
; O
but O
established O
upon O
fixed O
Principles O
of O
Law O
and O
Polity O
, O
and O
maintained O
by O
a O
regular O
, O
free O
, O
and O
equitable O
subordination O
. O

What O
are O
the O
principles O
which O
will O
best O
connect O
the O
Head O
and O
the O
Members O
of O
this O
great O
Empire B-Organization
is O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
present O
enquiry O
. O

They O
ought O
to O
be O
simple O
, O
plain O
, O
and O
certain O
, O
or O
they O
will O
not O
be O
suitable O
to O
their O
general O
purpose O
; O
they O
ought O
to O
be O
generally O
admitted O
, O
or O
they O
will O
not O
have O
their O
full O
effect O
; O
they O
must O
be O
such O
as O
will O
stand O
the O
test O
of O
reason O
, O
or O
they O
will O
not O
be O
generally O
admitted O
. O

In O
this O
disputative O
age O
, O
and O
in O
a O
science O
of O
all O
the O
most O
disputative O
, O
it O
may O
seem O
a O
difficult O
task O
to O
attempt O
to O
settle O
a O
general O
theory O
for O
a O
business O
in O
which O
such O
a O
variety O
of O
passions O
, O
prejudices O
, O
and O
interests O
, O
are O
like O
to O
interpose O
. O

Sensible O
of O
this O
, O
and O
studious O
only O
of O
Truth O
and O
Utility O
, O
the O
writer O
has O
avoided O
declamation O
, O
and O
kept O
close O
to O
argument O
. O

He O
has O
reduced O
his O
whole O
subject O
into O
a O
set O
of O
propositions O
; O
beginning O
with O
first O
principles O
which O
are O
self-evident O
, O
proceeding O
to O
propositions O
capable O
of O
positive O
proof O
, O
and O
descending O
to O
hypotheses O
which O
are O
to O
be O
determined O
by O
degrees O
of O
probability O
only O
. O

This O
was O
intended O
to O
be O
a O
perfect O
chain O
; O
the O
avoiding O
of O
prolixity O
is O
the O
cause O
why O
it O
is O
not O
so O
: O
where O
any O
links O
shall O
appear O
to O
be O
wanting O
, O
the O
judicious O
reader O
will O
easily O
supply O
them O
. O

The O
advantages O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
writing O
are O
obvious O
: O
by O
seeing O
the O
principles O
and O
the O
reasoning O
of O
the O
arguments O
laid O
before O
him O
articulately O
, O
the O
reader O
can O
more O
precisely O
determine O
what O
to O
assent O
to O
, O
and O
what O
to O
deny O
; O
and O
the O
writer O
, O
if O
he O
should O
appear O
to O
be O
mistaken O
, O
will O
have O
the O
merit O
of O
contributing O
to O
his O
own O
conviction O
. O

The O
present O
expectation O
, O
that O
a O
new O
Regulation O
of O
the O
American B-Organization
Governments I-Organization
will O
soon O
take O
place O
, O
probably O
arises O
more O
from O
the O
opinion O
the O
public O
has O
of O
the O
abilities O
of O
the O
present O
Ministry B-Organization
, O
than O
from O
any O
thing O
that O
has O
transpired O
from O
the O
Cabinet B-Organization
: O
it O
cannot O
be O
supposed O
that O
their O
penetration O
can O
overlook O
the O
necessity O
of O
such O
a O
Regulation O
, O
nor O
their O
public O
spirit O
fail O
to O
carry O
it O
into O
execution O
. O

But O
it O
may O
be O
a O
question O
, O
whether O
the O
present O
is O
a O
proper O
time O
for O
this O
work O
: O
more O
urgent O
business O
may O
stand O
before O
it O
; O
some O
preparatory O
steps O
may O
be O
required O
to O
precede O
it O
; O
caution O
and O
deliberation O
may O
retard O
it O
: O
but O
these O
will O
only O
serve O
to O
postpone O
. O

As O
we O
may O
expect O
that O
this O
Reformation O
, O
like O
all O
others O
, O
will O
be O
opposed O
by O
powerful O
prejudices O
, O
it O
may O
not O
be O
amiss O
to O
reason O
with O
them O
at O
leisure O
, O
and O
endeavour O
to O
take O
off O
their O
force O
before O
they O
become O
opposed O

Because O

The O
fund O
for O
the O

The O

otherwise O
money O

may O
be O
applied O

which O
seems O
not O
to O
be O
equitable O
. O
44 O
. O

Although O
the O
right O
of O
the O
Parliament B-Organization

Britain I-Organization
, O
to O
raise O
taxes O
in O
any O
parts O
of O
the O
British B-Location

is O
not O
to O
be O
disputed O
; O
yet O
it O
would O
be O
most O
adviseable O
to O
leave O
to O
the O
Provincial B-Organization

the O
raising O
the O
internal O
taxes O
. O
45 O
. O

If O
the O
sums O
required O
were O
fixed O
, O
there O
would O
be O
no O
inconvenience O
in O
letting O
the O
Provincial B-Organization

determine O
the O
manner O
in O
which O
they O
shall O
be O
raised O
. O
46 O
. O

It O
will O
be O
more O
agreeable O
to O
the O
people O
, O
that O
the O
necessary O
internal O
taxes O
should O
be O
raised O
by O
the O
Provincial B-Organization

; O
as O
they O
will O
be O
most O
able O
to O
consult O
the O
particular O
convenience O
of O
their O
respective O
provinces O
. O

Whereas O
, O
47 O
. O

It O
may O
be O
difficult O
to O
form O
a O
general O
Parliamentary O
tax O
, O
so O
as O
to O
make O
it O
equally O
suitable O
to O
all O
Provinces B-Location
. O
48 O
. O

It O
would O
make O
it O
more O
agreeable O
to O
the O
people O
; O
though O
the O
sum O
to O
be O
raised O
was O
prescribed O
, O
to O
leave O
the O
method O
of O
taxation O
to O
their O
own O
Legislature O
. O
49 O
. O

If O
the O
Provincial B-Organization
Legislatures I-Organization
should O
refuse O
to O
raise O
the O
sums O
required O
for O
the O
support O
of O
Government O
, O
or O
should O
insist O
upon O
doing O
it O
by O
improper O
means O
, O
the O
Parliament B-Organization
might O
then O
take O
the O
business O
into O
their O
own O
hands O
. O
50 O
. O

But O
it O
is O
most O
probable O
that O
the O
people O
would O
acquiesce O
in O
this O
measure O
, O
and O
would O
soon O
be O
reconciled O
to O
it O
, O
when O
they O
observed O
the O
good O
effects O
of O
a O
certain O
and O
adequate O
establishment O
for O
the O
support O
of O
Government O
. O

For O
51 O
. O

The O
want O
of O
such O
an O
establishment O
has O
had O
bad O
consequences O
in O
many O
of O
the O
Governments B-Organization
of I-Organization
the I-Organization
American I-Organization
colonies I-Organization
, O
and O
has O
contributed O
more O
than O
all O
other O
things O
put O
together O
, O
to O
contention O
in O
the O
legislature O
, O
and O
defect O
of O
justice O
in O
the O
courts B-Organization

Therefore O
, O
52 O
. O

The O
establishment O
of O
a O
certain O
, O
sufficient O
, O
and O
independent O
Civil O
List O
, O
is O
not O
only O
expedient O
, O
but O
necessary O
to O
the O
welfare O
of O
the O
American B-Organization

53 O

Such O
an O
appointment O
will O
tend O
greatly O
to O
remove O
all O
the O
seeds O
of O
contention O
, O
and O
to O
promote O
a O
lasting O
harmony O
and O
good O
understanding O
between O
the O
Government B-Organization
and O
the O
People O
. O
54 O
. O

The O
People O
of O
the O
colonies B-Location
ought O
not O
to O
object O
to O
such O
an O
appointment O
, O
because O
the O
support O
of O

is O
one O
of O
the O
terms O
upon O
which O
they O
have O
received O
the O
power O
of O

and O
, O
if O
the O
Government B-Organization
is O
not O
supported O
, O
the O
Legislation O
must O
cease O

because O
55 O

The O
Support O

to O
be O
certain O

sufficient O

otherwise O
the O
execution O
of O
it O
will O
be O
uncertain O
, O
and O
its O
powers O
insufficient O
for O
its O
purposes O
. O
56 O
. O

The O
Government B-Organization
ought O
not O
to O
be O
dependent O
upon O

The O
right O

, O
to O
judge O
of O
the O

does O
not O
conclude O
for O
the O
same O
right O
as O
to O
the O
ordinary O
and O
necessary O
expences O
; O
because O
58 O
. O

The O
former O
must O
be O
ever O
uncertain O
, O
the O
latter O
may O
be O
reduced O
to O
a O
certainty O
; O
the O
one O

The O
right O

A O

The O
propriety O
of O

Representation O

A O
Representation O
of O
the O
American B-Organization

in O
the O
Imperial B-Organization

is O
not O
necessary O
to O
establish O

authority O

But O
65 O

It O

66 O

The O
expediency O
of O

arise O
from O
the O
want O
of O
their O
having O
Representatives B-Organization

67 O
. O

If O
the O
American B-Organization

for O
their O

the O
support O

But O
68 O
. O

All O
external O
Legislatures O
must O
be O
subject O

dependent O

the O
Imperial B-Organization

: O
otherwise O
there O
would O
be O
an O
Empire O
in O
an O
Empire O

69 O

Some O
external O
States O
are O
incapable O
of O
a O
Legislature O
; O
which O
has O
often O
been O
the O
case O
of O
infant O
Colonies O
. O

Therefore O
, O
70 O
. O

The O
same O
form O
of O
Government O
is O
not O
equally O
proper O
to O
a O
Colony O
in O
its O
infant O
and O
in O
its O
mature O
state O

71 O
. O

There O
may O
be O
a O
middle O
state O
between O
infancy O

maturity O
, O
which O
may O
admit O
of O
a O
form O
of O

more O
proper O
for O
it O
than O
either O
of O
the O
extremes O

There O
is O
but O
one O
most O
perfect O
form O
of O
Government O

arrived O
at O
maturity O

73 O
. O

That O
is O
the O
most O
perfect O
form O

which O
approaches O

of O
the O

differs O

it O
as O
little O

possible O

74 O
. O

There O
is O
no O
such O
form O
of O
Government O
among O
the O
American B-Organization

And O
therefore O
75 O
. O

Every O
American B-Organization

is O
capable O
of O
having O
its O
Constitution O
altered O

76 O
. O

The O
Grants O
of O
the O

cannot O
be O
understood O

77 O

They O
cannot O
be O
intended O
for O
their O
mature O

that O

because O
they O
are O
in O

Therefore O

78 O

If O
the O

they O

To O
make O
the O

Province O
the O
most O
perfect O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
regard O
the O
Extension O

well O
as O
the O

A O
Province O
should O
be O
so O
extended O
, O
that O
the O
honourable O
support O
of O
the O
Government B-Organization
should O
not O
be O
burthensome O
; O
and O
so O
confined O
, O
that O
the O
assembling O

Legislature O
may O
not O
be O
inconvenient O

Where O
the O
Legislature O
can O
meet O
without O
inconvenience O
, O
the O
larger O
a O

is O
, O
the O
more O
effectual O

be O
the O

The O
notion O
which O
has O
heretofore O
prevailed O
, O
that O
the O
dividing O
America B-Location
into O
many O
governments O
, O
and O
different O
modes O
of O
government O
, O
will O
be O
the O
means O
to O
prevent O
their O
uniting O
to O
revolt O
, O
is O
ill-founded O
; O
since O
, O
if O
the O
Governments O
were O
ever O
so O
much O
consolidated O
, O
it O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
have O
so O
many O
distinct O
States O
, O
as O
to O
make O
an O
union O
to O
revolt O
impracticable O
. O

Whereas O
, O
84 O
. O

The O
splitting O
America B-Location
into O
many O
small O
governments O
, O
weakens O
the O
governing O
power O
, O
and O
strengthens O
that O
of O
the O
people O
; O
and O
thereby O
makes O
revolting O
more O
probable O
and O
more O
practicable O
. O
85 O
. O

To O
prevent O
revolts O
in O
future O
times O
( O
for O
there O
is O
no O
room O
to O
fear O
them O
in O
the O
present O
) O
the O
most O
effectual O
means O
would O
be O
, O
to O
make O
the O
governments O
large O
and O
respectable O
, O
and O
balance O
the O
powers O
of O
them O
. O
86 O
. O

There O
is O
no O
Government O
in O
America B-Location
at O
present O
, O
whose O
powers O
are O
properly O
balanced O
; O
there O
not O
being O
in O
any O
of O
them O
a O
real O
and O
distinct O
third O
Legislative O
power O
mediating O
between O
the O
King B-Organization
and O
the O
People O
, O
which O
is O
the O
peculiar O
excellence O
of O
the O
British O
Constitution O
. O
87 O
. O

The O
want O
of O
such O
a O
third O
Legislative O
power O
, O
adds O
weight O
to O
the O
popular O
, O
and O
lightens O
the O
royal O
scale O
: O
so O
as O
to O
destroy O
the O
balance O
between O
the O
royal O
and O
popular O
powers O
. O
88 O

Although O
America B-Organization
is O
not O
now O
( O
and O
probably O
will O
not O
be O
for O
many O
years O
to O
come O
) O
ripe O
enough O
for O
an O
hereditary O
Nobility O
; O
yet O
it O
is O
now O
capable O
of O
a O
Nobility O
for O
life O
. O
89 O
. O

A O
Nobility O
appointed O
by O
the O
King B-Organization
for O
life O
, O
and O
made O
independent O
, O
would O
probably O
give O
strength O
and O
stability O
to O
the O
American B-Organization
governments I-Organization
, O
as O
effectually O
as O
an O
hereditary O
Nobility O
does O
to O
that O
of O
Great B-Organization
Britain I-Organization
. O
90 O
. O

The O
reformation O
of O
the O
American B-Organization
governments I-Organization
should O
not O
be O
controlled O
by O
the O
present O
boundaries O
of O
the O
colonies B-Location
; O
as O
they O
were O
mostly O
settled O
upon O
partial O
, O
occasional O
, O
and O
accidental O
considerations O
, O
without O
any O
regard O
to O
a O
whole O
. O
91 O
. O

To O
settle O
the O
American B-Organization
governments I-Organization
to O
the O
greatest O
possible O
advantage O
, O
it O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
reduce O
the O
number O
of O
them O
; O
in O
some O
places O
to O
unite O
and O
consolidate O
; O
in O
others O
to O
separate O
and O
transfer O
; O
and O
in O
general O
to O
divide O
by O
natural O
boundaries O
instead O
of O
imaginary O
lines O
. O
92 O
. O

If O
there O
should O
be O
but O
one O
form O
of O
Government O
established O
for O
all O
the O
North B-Location
American I-Location
Provinces I-Location
, O
it O
would O
greatly O
facilitate O
the O
reformation O
of O
them O
: O
since O
, O
if O
the O
mode O
of O
Government O
was O
every O
where O
the O
same O
, O
people O
would O
be O
more O
indifferent O
under O
what O
division O
they O
were O
ranged O
. O
93 O
. O

No O
objections O
ought O
to O
arise O
to O
the O
alteration O
of O
the O
boundaries O
of O
provinces O
from O
Proprietors O
, O
on O
account O
of O
their O
property O
only O
; O
since O
there O
is O
no O
occasion O
that O
it O
should O
in O
the O
least O
affect O
the O
boundaries O
of O
properties O
. O
94 O
. O

The O
present O
distinctions O
of O
one O
government O
being O
more O
free O
or O
more O
popular O
than O
another O
, O
tend O
to O
embarrass O
and O
to O
weaken O
the O
whole O
; O
and O
should O
not O
be O
allowed O
to O
subsist O
among O
people O
, O
subject O
to O
one O
King O
and O
one O
Law O
, O
and O
all O
equally O
fit O
for O
one O
form O
of O
Government O
. O
95 O
. O

The O
American B-Organization
colonies I-Organization
, O
in O
general O
, O
are O
at O
this O
time O
arrived O
at O
that O
state O
, O
which O
qualifies O
them O
to O
receive O
the O
most O
perfect O
form O
of O
government O
, O
which O
their O
situation O
and O
relation O
to O
Great B-Organization
Britain I-Organization
make O
them O
capable O
of O
. O
96 O
. O

The O
people O
of O
North B-Location
America I-Location
, O
at O
this O
time O
, O
expect O
a O
revisal O
and O
reformation O
of O
the O
American B-Organization
Governments I-Organization
, O
and O
are O
better O
disposed O
to O
submit O
to O
it O
than O
ever O
they O
were O
, O
or O
perhaps O
ever O
will O
be O
again O
. O
97 O
. O

This O
is O
therefore O
the O
proper O
and O
critical O
time O
to O
reform O
the O
American B-Organization
governments I-Organization
upon O
a O
general O
, O
constitutional O
, O
firm O
, O
and O
durable O
plan O
; O
and O
if O
it O
is O
not O
done O
now O
, O
it O
will O
probably O
every O
day O
grow O
more O
difficult O
, O
till O
at O
last O
it O
becomes O
impracticable O
