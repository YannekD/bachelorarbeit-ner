The O
acquisition O
of O
millions O
of O
acres O
of O
territory O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
Peace O
of O
Paris B-Location
in O
1763 O
did O
not O
please O
all O
Englishmen O
. O

Knowing O
they O
could O
not O
keep O
everything O
they O
had O
conquered O
, O
some O
Britons O
wanted O
to O
retain O
the O
rich O
sugar-producing O
French O
islands O
of O
Martinique B-Location
and O
Guadeloupe B-Location
and O
return O
to O
France B-Organization
the O
barren O
wastes O
of O
Canada B-Location

Following O
debates O
in O
the O
English O
press O
, O
in O
which O
Benjamin B-Person
Franklin I-Person
participated O
, O
the O
jealousy O
of O
the O
British B-Location
sugar-producing I-Location
islands I-Location
and O
the O
prospect O
of O
new O
markets O
in O
North B-Location
America I-Location
for O
English O
manufactured O
goods O
convinced O
the O
government B-Organization
to O
keep O
Canada B-Location
and O
return O
the O
two O
sugar B-Location
islands I-Location
to O
France B-Location
. O

It O
was O
a O
fateful O
decision O
. O

Better O
to O
have O
given O
up O
Canada B-Location
and O
faced O
again O
the O
combined O
frontier O
menace O
of O

remark O
in O
1773 O

If O
Canada B-Location
had O
remained O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
France B-Organization
, O
declared O
Hutchinson B-Person
with O
the O
benefit O
of O
a O
decade O
of O
hindsight O
, O
“ O
none O
of O
the O
spirit O
of O
opposition O

the O
Mother B-Organization

appeared O

” O

“ O
Cato B-Person
, O
” O
the O
anonymous O
English O
author O
of O
this O
pamphlet O
, O
wrote O
with O
a O
sense O
of O
deep O
foreboding O
about O
Britain B-Organization
’ O
s O
immense O
acquisitions O
of O
what O
he O
took O
to O
be O
the O
virtually O
empty O
land O
of O
the O
New B-Location
World I-Location
. O

Not O
only O
anxious O
about O
the O
potential O
challenge O
posed O
by O
the O
development O
of O
trade O
and O
manufacturing O
in O
the O
colonies B-Location
, O
he O
expressed O
a O
concern O
, O
shared O
by O
many O
other O
Britons O
in O
the O
1760s O
and O
early O
1770s O
, O
about O
the O
large O
numbers O
of O
British O
subjects O
migrating O
to O
the O
colonies B-Location
. O

In O
some O
cases O
whole O
neighborhoods O
seemed O
to O
be O
pulling O
up O
stakes O
and O
sailing O
to O
America B-Location
, O
leaving O
behind O
the O
depopulated O
countryside O
famously O
described O
by O
Oliver B-Person
Goldsmith I-Person
in O
his O
1770 O
poem O
“ O
The O
Deserted O
Village O
. O
” O

Indeed O
, O
some O
British O
officials O
even O
contemplated O
a O
parliamentary O
ban O
on O
the O
exodus O
of O
people O
to O
America B-Location
. O

Dr O
. O

Samuel B-Person
Johnson I-Person
especially O
came O
to O
lament O
the O
scale O
of O
such O
emigration O
, O
which O
, O
he O
warned O
, O
would O
not O
only O
diminish O
the O
society O
of O
Britain B-Location
but O
would O
leave O
the O
migrating O
settlers O
scattered O
throughout O
the O
wilds O
of O
America B-Location
bereft O
of O
all O
civilization O
. O

Although O
Cato B-Person
’ O
s O
pamphlet O
suggested O
that O
the O
flight O
of O
Britons O
to O
the O
New B-Location
World I-Location
might O
act O
as O
a O
goad O
to O
reforming O
British O
society O
, O
it O
also O
revealed O
that O
even O
before O
the O
American O
crisis O
erupted O
there O
existed O
in O
London B-Location
a O
feeling O
that O
the O
vast O
extent O
of O
the O
colonies B-Location
in O
the O
New B-Location
World I-Location
might O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
more O
of O

than O
a O

SIR O
, O
A O
FTER O
the O
repeated O
Victories O
gained O
over O
the O
Minority O
, O
it O
is O
supposed O
that O
the O
two O
Houses B-Organization
of I-Organization
Parliament I-Organization
, O
and O
particularly O
that O
of O
the O
Commons B-Organization
, O
which O
hath O
nothing O
to O
do O
as O
a O
Court O
of O
Judicature O
, O
will O
employ O
themselves O
in O
concerting O
Measures O
for O
promoting O
the O
Good O
of O
the O
Nation B-Organization
. O

You O
ought O
to O
lose O
no O
Time O
in O
falling O
about O
this O
Work O
; O
for O
a O
quiet O
Interval O
, O
such O
as O
you O
now O
enjoy O
, O
is O
very O
rare O
in O
Countries O
where O
there O
is O
so O
much O
Liberty O
as O
we O
have O
at O
present O
; O
neither O
can O
it O
be O
expected O
to O
last O
long O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
Excuse O
that O
can O
be O
made O
for O
Ministers B-Organization
of I-Organization
State I-Organization
doing O
so O
little O
for O
the O
Public O
Benefit O
among O
us O
. O

The O
Duration O
of O
their O
Power O
is O
so O
uncertain O
, O
and O
its O
Extent O
so O
limited O
, O
even O
while O
they O
possess O
it O
, O
that O
few O
Designs O
of O
general O
Utility O
can O
be O
either O
projected O
or O
carried O
into O
Execution O
while O
it O
continues O
. O

Your O
present O
Opportunity O
therefore O
is O
the O
more O
precious O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
will O
not O
be O
altogether O
lost O
. O

It O
is O
very O
probable O
, O
however O
, O
that O
with O
the O
best O
Intentions O
in O
the O
World O
, O
you O
may O
be O
misled O
. O

Proposals O
for O
new O
Laws O
will O
probably O
be O
made O
and O
supported O
chiefly O
by O
those O
who O
have O
particular O
Interest O
in O
them O
; O
and O
this O
may O
be O
done O
with O
so O
much O
Plausibility O
as O
to O
deceive O
Persons O
of O
the O
best O
understanding O
. O

With O
great O
Humility O
, O
therefore O
, O
I O
submit O
the O
Thoughts O
in O
the O
following O
Tract O
to O
Your O
Consideration O
, O
and O
that O
of O
the O
Publick O
. O

They O
arise O
from O
Attachment O
to O
no O
Party O
, O
and O
, O
so O
far O
as O
I O
can O
perceive O
, O
to O
no O
particular O
Interest O
. O

They O
have O
been O
generated O
by O
Reading O
and O
Reflexion O
on O
the O
History O
of O
other O
Nations O
, O
and O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
Attention O
paid O
to O
the O
Causes O
of O
Prosperity O
or O
Decay O
in O
several O
Cities O
and O
Counties O
of O
this O
Kingdom B-Location
. O

I O
have O
generally O
found O
, O
that O
Bodies O
of O
Men O
, O
as O
well O
as O
private O
Persons O
, O
were O
incessantly O
pursuing O
after O
Things O
which O
proved O
prejudicial O
to O
them O
, O
after O
they O
had O
attained O
them O
. O

And O
in O
many O
Cases O
it O
was O
easy O
to O
see O
, O
after O
some O
Years O
Experience O
, O
that O
the O
Prosperity O
of O
Societies O
had O
been O
owing O
, O
in O
a O
great O
Measure O
, O
to O
a O
Circumstance O
or O
two O
, O
which O
all O
the O
while O
they O
were O
groaning O
under O
, O
and O
crying O
out O
against O
as O
an O
intolerable O
Grievance O
. O

Filled O
with O
Reflections O
of O
this O
Kind O
, O
I O
leave O
you O
to O
judge O
what O
were O
my O
Sentiments O
of O
the O
violent O
Clamours O
against O
the O
late O
Peace O
. O

I O
began O
to O
think O
what O
Dominions B-Location
the O
King B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great I-Organization
Britain I-Organization
now O
had O
, O
and O
what O
use O
he O
had O
for O
any O
more O
; O
and O
was O
soon O
led O
into O
a O
strong O
Suspicion O
, O
that O
, O
instead O
of O
having O
too O
little O
Land O
, O
he O
had O
by O
far O
too O
much O
. O

Whether O
in O
prosecuting O
those O
Reflections O
I O
have O
carried O
the O
Matter O
too O
great O
a O
Length O
, O
I O
shall O
not O
say O
, O
as O
we O
are O
all O
ready O
to O
run O
into O
Extremes O
. O

But O
one O
Thing O
is O
certain O
; O
that O
the O
Basis O
of O
all O
Deliberation O
on O
our O
Connection O
with O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
abroad O
, O
ought O
to O
be O
Not—how O
will O
they O
bring O
the O
greatest O
immediate O
Wealth O
into O
the O
Coffers O
of O
a O
few O
Merchants O
? O

Or O
how O
will O
they O
bring O
the O
greatest O
immediate O
Splendor O
to O
the O
City B-Location
of I-Location
London I-Location
? O

— O
But O
how O
will O
they O
continue O
to O
promote O
the O
Population O
of O
the O
Island B-Location
, O
and O
the O
Industry O
of O
the O
People O
of O
Great B-Location
Britain I-Location
? O

I O
sincerely O
wish O
you O
a O
good O
Session O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
, O
and O
am O
, O
SIR O
, O
Your O
most O
obedient O
Humble O
Servant O

CATO B-Person

Thoughts O
on O
a O
Question O
, O
& O
c O
. O

Whether O
is O
it O
probable O
that O
the O
Immense O
Extent O
of O
Territory O
acquired O
by O
this O
Nation B-Organization
at O
the O
late O
Peace O
, O
will O
operate O
towards O
the O
Prosperity O
, O
or O
the O
Ruin O
of O
the O
Island B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great-Britain I-Organization
? O

I O
proposed O
this O
Question O
to O
the O
Public O
, O
because O
, O
after O
thinking O
upon O
it O
a O
good O
deal O
in O
the O
most O
cool O
and O
dispassionate O
Manner O
, O
my O
own O
Opinion O
is O
still O
, O
in O
a O
great O
Measure O
, O
undetermined O
. O

Let O
no O
Man O
imagine O
it O
is O
a O
Political O
or O
Party O
Question O
. O

I O
believe O
the O
Ministers B-Organization
of I-Organization
State I-Organization
, O
in O
negotiating O
the O
late O
Peace O
, O
acted O
as O
wisely O
and O
sincerely O
as O
any O
who O
have O
been O
before O
them O
employed O
in O
the O
like O
Work O
; O
subject O
however O
at O
the O
same O
time O
to O
the O
Errors O
and O
Prejudices O
which O
are O
inseparable O
from O
Humanity O
. O

I O
would O
not O
at O
this O
Moment O
give O
three O
Farthings O
, O
for O
my O
own O
particular O
Part O
, O
to O
determine O
which O
of O
the O
Parties O
, O
Majority O
or O
Minority O
should O
prevail O
. O

Neither O
do O
I O
think O
it O
is O
of O
any O
Importance O
to O
the O
Public O
, O
except O
in O
so O
far O
as O
every O
good O
Subject O
would O
wish O
, O
that O
His O
Majesty B-Person
should O
partake O
a O
little O
of O
the O
Peace O
and O
Quiet O
which O
we O
so O
happily O
enjoy O
under O
his O
Government O
. O

Having O
proposed O
the O
Question O
, O
no O
more O
should O
have O
been O
said O
upon O
it O
by O
me O
, O
were O
it O
not O
for O
the O
following O
Circumstance O
. O

Some O
perhaps O
who O
have O
given O
Credit O
to O
my O
Declaration O
, O
that O
it O
is O
not O
Politically O
intended O
, O
may O
still O
be O
so O
clear O
upon O
one O
Side O
, O
as O
to O
despise O
and O
count O
it O
Ridiculous O
. O

I O
shall O
therefore O
throw O
out O
a O
few O
general O
Reflections O
which O
have O
led O
me O
to O
look O
upon O
it O
, O
as O
, O
at O
least O
, O
Problematical O
; O
and O
I O
am O
sure O
if O
it O
be O
doubtful O
, O
no O
Man O
can O
deny O
that O
it O
is O
Important O
. O

The O
Territory O
acquired O
is O
so O
immense O
, O
that O
it O
must O
make O
the O
Time O
of O
Acquisition O
a O
remarkable O
Æra O
of O
this O
Government B-Organization
, O
and O
produce O
a O
great O
HAVE O
Change O
in O
our O
Situation O
and O
Circumstances O
as O
a O
Society O
. O

As O
the O
smallest O
Member O
of O
a O
Natural O
Body O
affects O
the O
whole O
in O
some O
Degree O
; O
so O
every O
one O
Circumstance O
with O
regard O
to O
a O
Political O
Body O
, O
has O
some O
Influence O
upon O
every O
other O
. O

A O
Nation O
must O
accommodate O
itself O
some O
way O
or O
other O
, O
well O
or O
ill O
, O
to O
the O
whole O
Extent O
of O
its O
Territory O
. O

The O
most O
distant O
and O
desolate O
Part O
of O
the O
Dominions O
of O
any O
People O
, O
has O
some O
Relation O
to O
them O
, O
either O
as O
a O
Benefit O
or O
Burthen O
; O
otherwise O
it O
is O
not O
their O
’ O
s O
. O

Hence O
it O
follows O
, O
that O
any O
Acquisition O
would O
have O
produced O
some O
Change O
; O
and O
therefore O
so O
great O
an O
Acquisition O
, O
and O
that O
made O
all O
at O
once O
, O
must O
produce O
a O
very O
great O
one O
. O

Men O
have O
often O
conjectured O
wrong O
, O
perhaps O
they O
have O
seldom O
conjectured O
right O
, O
as O
to O
the O
Effects O
of O
great O
Changes O
in O
a O
State O
or O
Government O
, O
till O
they O
felt O
them O
by O
Experience O
. O

The O
Spanish B-Organization
Monarchy I-Organization
, O
at O
the O
Time O
when O
it O
got O
Possession O
of O
the O
West B-Location
Indies I-Location
, O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
powerful O
, O
if O
not O
the O
most O
powerful O
and O
flourishing O
in O
Europe B-Location
. O

Would O
not O
any O
Man O
at O
that O
Time O
have O
been O
reckoned O
disordered O
in O
his O
Judgment O
, O
who O
should O
have O
affirmed O
, O
that O
the O
Kingdom B-Organization
would O
be O
the O
worse O
for O
that O
Addition O
; O
and O
particularly O
that O
it O
would O
become O
poor O
by O
Means O
of O
the O
Gold O
and O
Silver O
Mines O
? O

Yet O
do O
we O
not O
know O
that O
it O
proved O
so O
in O
Fact O
; O
and O
that O
there O
is O
not O
now O
any O
Man O
of O
the O
least O
Political O
Reflection O
, O
but O
can O
explain O
for O
what O
Reasons O
it O
was O
, O
and O
behoved O
to O
be O
so O
? O

That O
solemn O
People O
believed O
that O
they O
should O
possess O
all O
Things O
without O
working O
, O
because O
they O
had O
plenty O
of O
Gold O
, O
which O
they O
had O
always O
hitherto O
seen O
sufficient O
to O
Purchase O
all O
Things O
. O

They O
only O
forgot O
, O
that O
as O
they O
could O
neither O
eat O
nor O
wear O
Gold O
, O
they O
must O
necessarily O
pay O
to O
such O
as O
would O
work O
for O
them O
, O
just O
in O
Proportion O
to O
the O
Abundance O
of O
Gold O
they O
possessed O
. O

Thus O
their O
Stock O
was O
soon O
exhausted O
, O
and O
would O
have O
been O
so O
, O
perhaps O
sooner O
, O
if O
it O
had O
been O
a O
thousand O
times O
greater O
than O
it O
was O
. O

When O
either O
a O
Person O
or O
People O
are O
ruined O
by O
too O
much O
of O
any O
thing O
that O
is O
good O
in O
a O
moderate O
Degree O
, O
the O
greater O
the O
Quantity O
, O
their O
Ruin O
comes O
on O
so O
much O
the O
more O
speedily O
.1 O
I O
know O
it O
will O
be O
said O
( O
and O
perhaps O
every O
Reader O
is O
before-hand O
with O
me O
in O
thinking O
it O
) O
“ O
We O
have O
not O
got O
more O
Money O
to O
make O
us O
idle O
, O
but O
more O
Land O
, O
which O
we O
may O
have O
an O
Opportunity O
to O
improve O
. O
” O

But O
I O
must O
beg O
leave O
to O
ask O
, O
Is O
any O
Man O
sure O
that O
it O
is O
not O
possible O
to O
get O
too O
much O
Land O
, O
as O
well O
as O
too O
much O
Money O
? O

We O
have O
now O
from O
the O
Gulph B-Location
of I-Location
Florida I-Location
to O
the O
North-Pole B-Location
, O
at O
least O
with O
very O
little O
Exception O
; O
how O
far O
West O
I O
really O
do O
not O
know O
. O

What O
pity O
is O
it O
that O
we O
did O
not O
keep O
the O
whole O
Island B-Location
of I-Location
Cuba I-Location
, O
and O
by O
another O
Year O
’ O
s O
War O
, O
take O
from O
the O
Spaniards O
all O
their O
Possessions O
in O
SouthAmerica B-Location
? O

After O
we O
had O
done O
so O
, O
there O
would O
have O
remained O
still O
some O
more O
of O
the O
Globe O
to O
conquer O
. O

Is O
not O
the O
Lust O
of O
Conquest O
in O
a O
Nation O
as O
insatiable O
as O
the O
Lust O
of O
Gold O
in O
a O
Miser O
? O

And O
is O
it O
not O
much O
more O
hurtful O
? O

If O
any O
thinks O
otherwise O
, O
if O
he O
either O
thinks O
we O
have O
not O
enough O
, O
or O
not O
more O
than O
enough O
at O
present O
, O
let O
him O
explain O
clearly O
the O
Reasons O
of O
his O
Opinion O
, O
and O
what O
will O
be O
the O
probable O
Effect O
of O
the O
Acquisition O
upon O
the O
Society O
. O

There O
is O
the O
greater O
need O
of O
Accuracy O
in O
this O
Matter O
, O
that O
I O
believe O
the O
Event O
, O
taking O
in O
all O
its O
Circumstances O
, O
is O
quite O
singular O
, O
the O
like O
never O
having O
happened O
before O
. O

Some O
Nations O
formerly O
have O
in O
the O
Course O
of O
a O
few O
Years O
, O
conquered O
great O
Tracts O
of O
Country O
; O
but O
they O
ordinarily O
obtained O
new O
Subjects O
as O
well O
as O
new O
Ground O
: O
Whereas O
our O
late O
Acquisition O
may O
be O
justly O
called O
mere O
Earth O
. O

Nay O
, O
though O
we O
had O
all O
that O
the O
Indians O
possess O
behind O
, O
as O
which O
we O
shall O
very O
soon O
have O
, O
it O
will O
be O
the O
same O
Thing O
; O
for O
they O
seem O
upon O
the O
Eve O
of O
either O
dwindling O
into O
nothing O
of O
themselves O
, O
or O
being O
exterminated O
by O
us O
.2 O
Has O
it O
not O
been O
long O
ago O
agreed O
upon O
by O
Persons O
of O
Reason O
and O
Observation O
, O
that O
it O
is O
not O
the O
Extent O
of O
a O
Country O
, O
but O
the O
Number O
of O
Inhabitants O
in O
proportion O
to O
its O
Extent O
, O
that O
constitutes O
the O
Strength O
of O
a O
Nation O
? O

If O
I O
am O
not O
mistaken O
, O
it O
used O
to O
be O
affirmed O
in O
some O
such O
Proportion O
as O
this O
, O
that O
supposing O
ten O
Millions O
of O
People O
to O
inhabit O
one O
Country O
, O
and O
the O
same O
Number O
to O
inhabit O
another O
of O
double O
the O
Extent O
, O
the O
first O
State O
would O
be O
four O
times O
as O
powerful O
as O
the O
last O
. O

Is O
this O
Maxim O
now O
found O
to O
be O
false O
? O

Or O
, O
on O
what O
Account O
is O
it O
not O
applicable O
to O
our O
Case O
? O

If O
we O
take O
Great-Britain B-Organization
and O
its O
Colonies B-Organization
as O
one O
Body O
, O
I O
do O
not O
see O
what O
should O
hinder O
it O
to O
be O
applied O
. O

If O
we O
take O
them O
as O
separate O
Bodies O
in O
Alliance O
, O
from O
which O
Alliance O
we O
in O
this O
Nation B-Organization
hitherto O
derived O
great O
Advantages O
, O
I O
acknowledge O
it O
in O
Part O
. O

But O
my O
Question O
still O
remains O
; O
will O
these O
endless O
Tracts O
of O
Ground O
, O
in O
future O
Times O
, O
fill O
this O
Kingdom B-Location
with O
Inhabitants O
, O
or O
depopulate O
it O
? O

First O
, O
let O
us O
suppose O
Great-Britain B-Organization
and O
its O
Colonies B-Organization
as O
one O
Society O
. O

I O
am O
very O
sensible O
that O
a O
Situation O
can O
be O
supposed O
, O
and O
that O
many O
Nations O
have O
been O
in O
such O
a O
Situation O
, O
as O
that O
occupying O
waste O
Grounds O
has O
tended O
to O
increase O
both O
their O
Number O
and O
Strength O
. O

It O
increases O
their O
Number O
without O
Question O
, O
because O
when O
the O
Means O
of O
Subsistence O
are O
made O
easy O
, O
the O
common O
People O
are O
encouraged O
to O
marry O
. O

But O
before O
it O
can O
increase O
their O
Strength O
, O
I O
apprehend O
two O
Conditions O
are O
essentially O
requisite O
. O
1st O
. O

That O
the O
Land O
they O
have O
already O
be O
fully O
stocked O
, O
and O
likely O
to O
continue O
so O
. O

If O
this O
is O
not O
the O
Case O
, O
the O
Migration O
is O
unnecessary O
at O
least O
, O
if O
not O
hurtful O
. O
2d O
. O

There O
is O
another O
Condition O
, O
not O
so O
commonly O
thought O
of O
, O
necessary O
to O
a O
People O
’ O
s O
increasing O
in O
Strength O
by O
settling O
more O
Land O
. O

What O
I O
mean O
is O
, O
that O
there O
be O
a O
plain O
and O
simple O
Taste O
of O
Life O
, O
so O
that O
Agriculture O
may O
support O
them O
comfortably O
. O

This O
was O
the O
Case O
with O
the O
Romans O
in O
the O
early O
Times O
of O
their O
Republick B-Organization
, O
as O
well O
as O
many O
other O
antient O
Nations O
. O

Now O
it O
must O
be O
considered O
, O
that O
they O
had O
very O
little O
either O
of O
Commerce O
or O
Manufactures O
; O
so O
that O
they O
soon O
became O
not O
only O
full O
, O
but O
overstocked O
; O
and O
having O
nothing O
but O
the O
Fruits O
of O
their O
own O
Ground O
to O
support O
them O
, O
they O
were O
obliged O
to O
send O
Colonies O
abroad O
. O

These O
Colonies B-Organization
went O
not O
to O
seek O
Wealth O
, O
but O
Food O
. O

So O
simple O
was O
their O
Taste O
of O
Life O
, O
that O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
Roman B-Organization
State I-Organization
, O
a O
Family O
was O
decently O
maintained O
upon O
one O
Acre O
and O
a O
Quarter O
of O
an O
Acre O
English O
. O

When O
Appius B-Person
Clausus I-Person
left O
the O
Sabines O
, O
he O
brought O
with O
him O
to O
Rome B-Location
five O
thousand O
Sabine O
Families O
, O
to O
each O
of O
whom O
the O
above O
Quantity O
was O
assigned O
, O
and O
that O
Great B-Person
Man I-Person
had O
the O
immense O
Estate O
of O
fifteen O
Acres O
given O
to O
himself O
. O

How O
different O
from O
the O
late O
Grants O
of O
American B-Location
Lands I-Location
? O

Let O
us O
carefully O
remember O
therefore O
, O
that O
it O
must O
be O
Manufacture O
and O
Commerce O
only O
, O
which O
can O
make O
a O
People O
numerous O
and O
prosperous O
, O
after O
Elegance O
and O
Luxury O
have O
been O
once O
introduced O
. O

Now O
it O
is O
at O
least O
very O
doubtful O
, O
whether O
a O
narrow O
be O
not O
more O
favourable O
than O
an O
extended O
Territory O
for O
their O
Advancement O
. O

There O
is O
less O
Necessity O
either O
of O
Manufactures O
or O
Commerce O
in O
an O
extended O
Territory O
, O
because O
the O
Multitude O
of O
common O
People O
, O
by O
whose O
Hands O
National O
Industry O
must O
be O
carried O
on O
, O
can O
easily O
find O
Support O
without O
them O
: O
Whereas O
when O
they O
are O
confined O
to O
their O
own O
Bounds O
, O
those O
who O
cannot O
be O
Husbandmen O
, O
are O
obliged O
to O
be O
Artificers O
. O

I O
believe O
Experience O
will O
confirm O
this O
Observation O
, O
whether O
we O
consider O
the O
State O
of O
Mankind O
in O
antient O
or O
modern O
Times O
. O

But O
let O
us O
now O
suppose O
our O
Colonies B-Organization
separate O
Bodies O
in O
Alliance O
with O
us O
. O

It O
will O
probably O
be O
thought O
that O
these O
Settlements O
growing O
in O
Numbers O
, O
in O
the O
same O
Manner O
and O
from O
the O
same O
Causes O
, O
that O
all O
new O
planted O
Colonies O
do O
, O
their O
Commerce O
, O
which O
is O
confined O
to O
us O
, O
must O
be O
of O
great O
Benefit O
to O
this O
Island B-Organization
. O

And O
no O
doubt O
if O
they O
be O
serviceable O
at O
all O
, O
this O
is O
the O
single O
Light O
in O
which O
they O
can O
be O
so O
to O
us O
. O

How O
far O
they O
have O
been O
so O
hitherto O
, O
I O
do O
not O
enquire O
; O
but O
whether O
they O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
so O
, O
or O
not O
, O
seems O
to O
me O
very O
uncertain O
, O
for O
several O
Reasons O
. O
1 O
. O

They O
seem O
to O
threaten O
us O
with O
an O
Evil O
, O
not O
only O
dangerous O
or O
troublesome O
, O
but O
ruinous O
, O
viz O
. O

Depopulation O
. O

Settling O
small O
Colonies O
may O
do O
such O
Services O
as O
to O
Counterballance O
an O
inconsiderable O
Loss O
of O
People O
; O
but O
settling O
vast O
Tracts O
may O
exhaust O
the O
Mother B-Organization
Country I-Organization
, O
and O
prove O
Destruction O
. O

Letting O
a O
little O
Blood O
may O
be O
not O
only O
harmless O
, O
but O
serviceable O
to O
the O
Body O
; O
and O
yet O
excessive O
Bleeding O
will O
kill O
as O
certainly O
as O
any O
Disease O
, O
to O
which O
it O
is O
liable O
. O

I O
shall O
not O
spend O
Time O
in O
enumerating O
the O
various O
Ways O
in O
which O
our O
Colonies B-Organization
drain O
us O
of O
People O
. O

Men O
of O
Rank O
or O
Wealth O
, O
who O
have O
obtained O
Grants O
of O
Lands O
, O
spare O
no O
pains O
to O
inveigle O
them O
away O
in O
Crowds O
to O
settle O
their O
several O
Possessions O
, O
because O
without O
People O
these O
Possessions O
are O
good O
for O
nothing O
. O

Multitudes O
go O
away O
of O
their O
own O
accord O
, O
allured O
by O
the O
enchanting O
Prospect O
of O
Wealth O
; O
and O
either O
never O
return O
at O
all O
, O
or O
return O
in O
a O
frail O
diseased O
State O
, O
unfit O
for O
Propagation O
. O

We O
suffer O
no O
inconsiderable O
Loss O
in O
the O
many O
thousands O
of O
Seamen O
and O
Soldiers O
, O
which O
must O
now O
be O
sent O
to O
all O
Parts O
of O
the O
known O
World O
, O
to O
annoy O
our O
Enemies O
in O
Time O
of O
War O
, O
and O
to O
protect O
our O
Friends O
in O
Time O
of O
Peace O
. O

If O
all O
the O
Men O
who O
died O
an O
untimely O
Death O
by O
Sickness O
, O
Famine O
or O
the O
Sword O
, O
in O
the O
Havannah O
Expedition O
, O
had O
been O
employed O
in O
some O
useful O
Occupation O
in O
Great B-Location
Britain I-Location
, O
they O
and O
their O
Posterity O
, O
would O
have O
been O
of O
greater O
Benefit O
to O
this O
Nation B-Organization
, O
than O
any O
two O
Islands O
in O
the O
West-Indies B-Location
. O

The O
farther O
Investigation O
of O
this O
I O
leave O
to O
every O
Reader O
, O
that O
he O
may O
compute O
the O
Numbers O
in O
his O
own O
Mind O
. O

Let O
me O
only O
observe O
, O
that O
in O
Proportion O
as O
the O
Number O
of O
Hands O
is O
lessened O
, O
the O
Price O
of O
Labour O
, O
and O
the O
first O
Cost O
of O
our O
exported O
Commodities O
must O
be O
increased O
; O
at O
the O
very O
same O
Time O
the O
Quantity O
of O
these O
Commodities O
must O
decrease O
, O
and O
the O
Gain O
upon O
them O
centering O
here O
, O
must O
be O
diminished O
by O
the O
two O
concurring O
Causes O
. O

If O
therefore O
a O
Trade O
to O
our O
foreign O
Plantations B-Organization
be O
highly O
profitable O
, O
we O
ought O
to O
be O
the O
more O
concerned O
, O
lest O
by O
driving O
the O
Matter O
too O
far O
, O
we O
leave O
next O
to O
no-body O
at O
home O
to O
trade O
with O
them O
. O

Every O
thing O
may O
be O
Evidence O
. O

Many O
a O
Gentleman O
has O
laid O
out O
so O
much O
Money O
in O
building O
an O
elegant O
Palace O
, O
that O
he O
has O
left O
himself O
no O
Estate O
on O
which O
he O
might O
possess O
and O
enjoy O
it O
. O
2 O
. O

The O
Advantage O
is O
in O
Danger O
of O
being O
lost O
another O
Way O
. O

Our O
Plantations B-Organization
are O
becoming O
so O
extensive O
, O
that O
it O
is O
probable O
they O
will O
speedily O
set O
up O
Manufactures O
of O
their O
own O
, O
and O
be O
our O
Rivals O
instead O
of O
our O
Customers O
. O

This O
Effect O
will O
be O
accelerated O
by O
the O
Circumstance O
formerly O
mentioned O
. O

Our O
Commodities O
will O
not O
be O
sufficient O
in O
Quantity O
for O
them O
to O
consume O
, O
and O
they O
will O
be O
too O
costly O
for O
them O
to O
purchase O
. O

That O
this O
must O
be O
the O
Case O
in O
some O
future O
Period O
, O
from O
the O
natural O
Course O
of O
Things O
, O
many O
Writers O
have O
confessed O
; O
but O
they O
have O
generally O
considered O
it O
as O
at O
a O
very O
great O
Distance O
, O
and O
therefore O
unworthy O
of O
Attention O
. O

There O
are O
however O
at O
this O
Time O
many O
Symptoms O
of O
its O
being O
much O
nearer O
than O
we O
apprehended O
. O

The O
only O
Thing O
by O
which O
it O
is O
retarded O
, O
is O
, O
that O
as O
Land O
is O
cheap O
in O
America B-Location
, O
and O
Labour O
dear O
, O
it O
is O
a O
more O
immediate O
and O
sure O
Way O
for O
a O
Family O
to O
get O
Bread O
by O
cultivating O
the O
Ground O
, O
than O
by O
fabricating O
Goods O
, O
which O
may O
be O
brought O
on O
easy O
Terms O
from O
Great-Britain B-Location
. O

But O
this O
will O
soon O
be O
at O
an O
End O
, O
both O
from O
the O
Numbers O
of O
People O
settled O
in O
Places O
near O
the O
Sea B-Location
, O
and O
from O
the O
unsatiable O
Avarice O
of O
the O
Proprietors O
of O
Land O
, O
who O
already O
begin O
rather O
to O
suffer O
their O
vast O
Possessions O
to O
lie O
waste O
, O
than O
part O
with O
them O
but O
at O
a O
very O
great O
Profit O
. O

The O
Truth O
is O
, O
I O
have O
some O
Suspicion O
that O
it O
has O
been O
at O
an O
End O
in O
several O
of O
our O
Colonies B-Organization
for O
some O
Time O
, O
and O
that O
nothing O
stands O
in O
the O
Way O
but O
the O
Difficulties O
and O
Discouragements O
which O
attend O
the O
first O
setting O
up O
of O
Manufactures O
in O
every O
Country O
. O

Whenever O
Interest O
or O
Necessity O
therefore O
shall O
overcome O
these O
Difficulties O
, O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
foresee O
what O
an O
amazing O
and O
rapid O
Progress O
will O
be O
made O
in O
every O
Branch O
of O
Business O
, O
by O
an O
enterprizing O
and O
industrious O
People O
. O

Is O
there O
not O
also O
a O
Confirmation O
of O
this O
from O
Experience O
. O

If O
any O
Credit O
may O
be O
given O
to O
our O
News-papers O
, O
many O
Tradesmen O
have O
of O
late O
gone O
from O
different O
Parts O
of O
the O
Kingdom B-Location
to O
America B-Location
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
said O
no O
less O
than O
one O
hundred O
, O
of O
one O
Profession O
, O
from O
one O
Place O
, O
and O
at O
one O
Time O
.3 O
It O
has O
also O
been O
affirmed O
, O
that O
several O
different O
Branches O
of O
Manufacture O
are O
already O
set O
up O
in O
New-England B-Location
: O
And O
our O
Merchants O
at O
home O
( O
who O
, O
however O
little O
they O
understand O
of O
the O
Interest O
of O
the O
Public O
, O
understand O
their O
own O
immediate O
Interest O
well O
enough O
) O
are O
making O
dreadful O
outcries O
upon O
it O
. O

We O
are O
told O
it O
will O
be O
half O
a O
Million O
Sterling O
loss O
yearly O
to O
Great-Britain B-Location
; O
and O
I O
can O
easily O
believe O
it O
will O
very O
soon O
be O
double O
that O
Sum O
. O

But O
what O
Remedy O
? O

Mention O
has O
been O
made O
of O
applying O
to O
Parliament B-Organization
to O
hinder O
the O
Exportation O
of O
Artificers O
. O

On O
which O
I O
must O
beg O
leave O
to O
ask O
, O
Will O
they O
go O
if O
it O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
their O
Interest O
? O

And O
if O
it O
be O
their O
Interest O
, O
will O
you O
hinder O
them O
? O

Or O
if O
you O
would O
, O
how O
can O
you O
hinder O
them O
? O

I O
do O
not O
know O
whether O
the O
Parliament B-Organization
will O
pay O
any O
regard O
to O
these O
childish O
Complaints O
, O
or O
not O
; O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
that O
any O
Measures O
they O
could O
contrive O
for O
that O
purpose O
would O
be O
quite O
ineffectual O
. O
3 O
. O

I O
must O
examine O
another O
Circumstance O
in O
our O
Situation O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
Colonies B-Location
; O
viz O
. O

Our O
exclusive O
Right O
to O
trade O
with O
them O
. O

It O
may O
be O
said O
, O
let O
them O
be O
as O
extensive O
as O
you O
please O
; O
let O
them O
set O
up O
as O
many O
Manufactures O
as O
they O
themselves O
please O
: O
Still O
their O
Trade O
will O
be O
valuable O
, O
and O
it O
is O
wholly O
confined O
to O
this O
Island B-Location
, O
they O
are O
not O
permitted O
to O
carry O
on O
Business O
with O
any O
other O
Nation O
, O
but O
through O
the O
Medium O
of O
Great-Britain B-Organization
. O

But O
what O
signifies O
a O
Trade O
, O
if O
it O
come O
to O
be O
a O
losing O
Trade O
? O

And O
that O
, O
from O
some O
of O
the O
above O
Considerations O
, O
it O
may O
be O
sooner O
than O
we O
are O
aware O
of O
. O

Whenever O
they O
can O
supply O
themselves O
, O
with O
Manufactures O
they O
will O
have O
no O
need O
of O
us O
; O
most O
of O
the O
Luxuries O
and O
Delicacies O
of O
Life O
they O
can O
get O
nearer O
home O
from O
one O
another O
, O
and O
are O
indeed O
a O
kind O
of O
World O
in O
themselves O
. O

Besides O
, O
I O
strongly O
suspect O
this O
Circumstance O
of O
our O
having O
an O
exclusive O
Right O
to O
trade O
with O
them O
, O
will O
operate O
slowly O
and O
silently O
indeed O
, O
but O
constantly O
, O
and O
at O
last O
fatally O
, O
to O
our O
own O
Prejudice O
. O

There O
is O
much O
selfishness O
in O
human O
Nature O
; O
and O
it O
will O
be O
, O
nay O
probably O
it O
has O
been O
, O
a O
Temptation O
to O
us O
not O
to O
make O
our O
Manufactures O
as O
good O
and O
as O
cheap O
as O
possible O
to O
procure O
voluntary O
Purchasers O
, O
because O
we O
think O
we O
can O
send O
them O
to O
those O
who O
are O
obliged O
to O
take O
them O
. O

Let O
no O
Man O
think O
this O
a O
slight O
Circumstance O
, O
or O
of O
no O
Moment O
. O

Baron B-Person
Montesquieu I-Person
has O
observed O
, O
in O
more O
places O
than O
one O
of O
his O
Spirit O
of O
Laws O
, O
that O
the O
moral O
Causes O
of O
the O
Thriving O
or O
Decay O
of O
a O
Nation O
, O
viz O
. O
such O
as O
arise O
from O
the O
Tempers O
or O
Principles O
of O
the O
People O
, O
the O
Spirit O
of O
their O
Constitution O
, O
or O
their O
Situation O
with O
regard O
to O
others O
, O
are O
unspeakably O
more O
powerful O
than O
occasional O
Causes O
, O
such O
as O
War O
, O
Famine O
and O
Pestilence O
; O
or O
their O
Contraries O
. O

The O
Reason O
is O
plain—The O
Effect O
of O
those O
which O
he O
calls O
Moral O
Causes O
, O
tho O
’ O
Impracticable O
, O
is O
Universal O
and O
Perpetual O
. O

If O
therefore O
our O
exclusive O
Right O
to O
trade O
to O
our O
own O
Plantations B-Location
, O
tempts O
us O
to O
trust O
or O
lean O
too O
much O
to O
it O
, O
it O
may O
sink O
under O
the O
Weight O
, O
and O
prove O
the O
Cause O
of O
our O
Destruction O
. O

I O
think O
I O
have O
observed O
it O
asserted O
frequently O
by O
political O
Writers O
, O
when O
railing O
against O
the O
Government B-Organization
, O
that O
the O
Ballance O
of O
Trade O
is O
against O
us O
to O
every O
Nation O
, O
or O
almost O
every O
Nation O
in O
the O
World O
, O
except O
our O
own O
Plantations B-Location
. O

These O
Writers O
indeed O
are O
a O
sort O
of O
Witnesses O
, O
to O
whose O
Testimony O
the O
least O
Credit O
is O
to O
be O
given O
of O
any O
People O
under O
the O
Sun O
; O
for O
when O
it O
answers O
their O
Purpose O
, O
they O
will O
not O
stick O
to O
Assert O
not O
only O
the O
grossest O
, O
but O
the O
most O
manifest O
Falshoods O
, O
as O
if O
they O
were O
quite O
superior O
to O
any O
sense O
of O
Shame O
upon O
Detection O
. O

With O
Regard O
to O
this O
, O
in O
particular O
, O
I O
am O
pretty O
certain O
the O
Ballance O
cannot O
be O
against O
us O
to O
Spain B-Location
and O
Portugal B-Location
, O
because O
they O
have O
been O
already O
ruined O
in O
the O
very O
Way O
that O
I O
suspect O
our O
Ruin O
to O
be O
approaching O
. O

But O
if O
the O
Ballance O
be O
against O
us O
with O
other O
Nations O
, O
it O
is O
probable O
our O
Plantations B-Organization
themselves O
are O
the O
Cause O
of O
it O
, O
by O
shewing O
us O
an O
easy O
Way O
of O
making O
a O
considerable O
Profit O
, O
so O
that O
now O
we O
are O
not O
at O
so O
great O
Pains O
to O
Work O
as O
well O
and O
as O
cheap O
, O
and O
as O
much O
, O
as O
our O
Neighbours O
about O
us O
. O

This O
is O
naturally O
followed O
by O
another O
dangerous O
Consequence O
of O
our O
exclusive O
Trade O
. O

Our O
Merchants O
will O
import O
from O
other O
Nations O
what O
they O
can O
export O
to O
the O
British B-Location
Plantations I-Location
with O
Advantage O
. O

Such O
Commodities O
passing O
through O
our O
Hands O
make O
a O
great O
Appearance O
of O
Commerce O
, O
and O
yet O
add O
next O
to O
nothing O
to O
our O
Strength O
or O
Numbers O
; O
and O
not O
so O
much O
to O
our O
Wealth O
as O
may O
perhaps O
be O
supposed O
. O

This O
shews O
how O
it O
is O
at O
least O
possible O
, O
that O
our O
Possessions O
may O
have O
the O
same O
Effect O
upon O
us O
, O
that O
the O
Conquest O
of O
Mexico B-Location
and O
Peru B-Location
had O
upon O
the O
Spaniards O
. O

We O
may O
slacken O
our O
own O
Industry O
, O
and O
supply O
our O
Settlements O
by O
the O
Industry O
of O
others O
. O

Great O
Men O
and O
great O
Merchants O
who O
have O
Estates O
and O
Property O
abroad O
, O
may O
make O
a O
splendid O
Figure O
for O
a O
Time O
, O
while O
the O
Body O
of O
the O
Kingdom B-Organization
is O
gradually O
losing O
its O
Nourishment O
, O
and O
falling O
into O
an O
incurable O
Consumption O
. O

An O
exclusive O
Trade O
is O
of O
far O
less O
Consequence O
than O
may O
be O
imagined O
. O

The O
Spirit O
of O
Commerce O
, O
says O
a O
late O
eminent O
Author O
, O
is O
of O
a O
very O
nice O
and O
delicate O
Nature—I O
add O
, O
it O
is O
of O
a O
very O
subtile O
and O
penetrating O
Nature O
. O

The O
Reason O
is O
the O
same O
for O
both O
. O

It O
is O
animated O
and O
conducted O
entirely O
by O
the O
Interest O
of O
Individuals O
: O
So O
that O
unless O
this O
happens O
to O
co-incide O
with O
the O
public O
good O
, O
one O
Part O
of O
the O
Nation B-Organization
must O
be O
indefatigable O
in O
bringing O
on O
the O
Ruin O
of O
the O
Whole O
. O

Wherever O
Interest O
leads O
, O
or O
seems O
to O
lead O
, O
Trade O
will O
force O
its O
Way O
over O
all O
Obstructions O
; O
neither O
can O
it O
be O
almost O
by O
any O
Means O
forced O
to O
go O
another O
Way O
. O

We O
hear O
sometimes O
great O
Outcries O
against O
those O
mercenary O
Wretches O
, O
who O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
private O
Gain O
, O
will O
suck O
the O
very O
Blood O
of O
the O
Poor O
, O
and O
riot O
in O
the O
Spoils O
of O
their O
Country O
. O

Alas O
! O

you O
know O
little O
of O
Human O
Nature O
, O
if O
ever O
you O
expect O
to O
restrain O
the O
Plurality O
by O
such O
Arguments O
; O
or O
if O
you O
could O
hinder O
them O
from O
doing O
Ill O
, O
you O
will O
never O
make O
them O
do O
any O
Good O
. O

I O
remember O
not O
long O
ago O
, O
taking O
a O
Walk O
through O
the O
Streets O
of O
London B-Location
, O
I O
was O
led O
to O
reflect O
what O
an O
endless O
Variety O
of O
Designs O
must O
be O
carried O
on O
uniformly O
to O
supply O
the O
Inhabitants O
of O
that O
vast O
City O
, O
with O
every O
Necessary O
, O
and O
every O
imaginable O
Conveniency O
of O
Life O
; O
and O
it O
immediately O
occurred O
, O
that O
nothing O
but O
mutual O
Interest O
could O
do O
it O
. O

Without O
this O
, O
ten O
thousand O
Legislators O
constantly O
employed O
could O
not O
devise O
the O
Means O
, O
and O
an O
hundred O
thousand O
Judges O
could O
not O
enforce O
the O
Execution O
. O

The O
Spirit O
of O
all O
Laws O
on O
the O
Police O
of O
a O
City O
, O
or O
the O
Commerce O
of O
a O
People O
, O
must O
be O
to O
make O
public O
and O
private O
Interest O
not O
only O
really O
, O
but O
apparently O
and O
evidently O
the O
same O
. O

Hence O
it O
follows O
, O
that O
an O
exclusive O
Trade O
preserved O
by O
Force O
against O
the O
Inclination O
of O
the O
People O
concerned O
, O
cannot O
be O
carried O
very O
far O
, O
and O
cannot O
continue O
very O
long O
. O

While O
we O
serve O
our O
Plantations B-Organization
as O
well O
as O
other O
People O
, O
we O
may O
expect O
they O
will O
chearfully O
trade O
with O
us O
: O
So O
soon O
as O
we O
either O
will O
not O
, O
or O
cannot O
do O
this O
, O
they O
will O
use O
every O
possible O
Means O
to O
be O
supplied O
from O
another O
Quarter O
. O

The O
Spaniards O
have O
an O
exclusive O
Trade O
to O
their O
own O
Settlements B-Location
; O
and O
yet O
, O
if O
I O
am O
rightly O
informed O
, O
there O
are O
few O
Branches O
from O
which O
we O
derive O
greater O
Profit O
, O
than O
an O
illicit O
Trade O
forced O
at O
the O
Hazard O
both O
of O
Life O
and O
Fortune O
, O
from O
our O
West B-Location
India I-Location
Islands I-Location
to O
the O
Spanish B-Location
Main I-Location
. O

There O
have O
been O
lately O
some O
hideous O
Complaints O
against O
our O
Commanders O
of O
King B-Organization
’ O
s O
Ships O
for O
not O
encouraging O
this O
Trade O
. O

Would O
these O
Complainers O
be O
pleased O
that O
the O
Parliament B-Organization
should O
open O
a O
free O
Trade O
to O
all O
the O
World O
to O
our O
Plantations B-Location
? O

They O
would O
certainly O
burn O
or O
pull O
down O
that O
Member O
of O
Parliament B-Organization
’ I-Organization
s I-Organization
House I-Organization
who O
should O
move O
for O
it O
. O

Now O
I O
desire O
to O
know O
what O
an O
honest O
Man O
in O
Spain B-Location
would O
think O
of O
the O
Equity O
of O
this O
Procedure O
? O

It O
appears O
indeed O
, O
from O
what O
I O
have O
said O
above O
, O
that O
I O
do O
not O
expect O
much O
Equity O
from O
them O
, O
and O
therefore O
it O
is O
not O
upon O
that O
Side O
that O
I O
propose O
to O
press O
the O
Argument O
. O

It O
is O
from O
the O
side O
of O
Interest O
. O

If O
we O
are O
so O
partial O
to O
ourselves O
, O
as O
to O
trample O
upon O
every O
Law O
and O
every O
national O
Engagement O
, O
when O
we O
hope O
to O
do O
it O
with O
Impunity O
or O
Profit O
, O
why O
should O
we O
expect O
others O
to O
be O
more O
honest O
than O
ourselves O
, O
or O
that O
our O
Colonies B-Location
will O
continue O
to O
trade O
with O
us O
longer O
than O
it O
is O
their O
Interest O
to O
do O
so O
? O

For O
this O
Reason O
we O
should O
bend O
all O
our O
Force O
to O
the O
Improvement O
of O
our O
own O
Country B-Organization
, O
by O
increasing O
the O
Number O
, O
Sobriety O
and O
Industry O
of O
its O
Inhabitants O
. O

If O
there O
be O
any O
Defect O
here O
, O
the O
most O
valuable O
Settlements O
will O
do O
us O
no O
good O
; O
and O
if O
there O
be O
a O
visible O
Disproportion O
between O
our O
Colonies B-Location
and O
our O
Ability O
to O
trade O
with O
them O
, O
upon O
just O
and O
equal O
Terms O
, O
the O
more O
they O
are O
enlarged O
, O
the O
sooner O
shall O
we O
be O
destroyed O
. O

As O
I O
have O
all O
along O
professed O
the O
greatest O
Regard O
for O
the O
Parliament B-Organization
and O
Ministry B-Organization
, O
it O
will O
be O
thought O
, O
perhaps O
, O
that O
we O
may O
, O
without O
much O
Concern O
, O
leave O
the O
Care O
of O
the O
Public O
to O
them O
. O

Some O
Admirers O
of O
modern O
Improvements O
are O
apt O
to O
speak O
in O
very O
high O
Terms O
of O
the O
Discernment O
of O
this O
enlightened O
Age O
, O
as O
it O
is O
called O
. O

Such O
, O
it O
is O
not O
impossible O
, O
may O
be O
ready O
to O
say O
, O
“ O
Great O
National O
Mistakes O
have O
indeed O
formerly O
been O
committed O
, O
but O
the O
Principles O
of O
Trade O
and O
Commerce O
, O
as O
well O
as O
Government O
, O
are O
now O
so O
well O
understood O
that O
they O
will O
not O
be O
repeated O
. O

While O
Individuals O
are O
pursuing O
their O
own O
Interest O
with O
unremitting O
Activity O
, O
the O
Legislature B-Organization
, O
ever O
watchful O
for O
the O
general O
Good O
, O
and O
presiding O
over O
the O
whole O
, O
will O
observe O
the O
first O
Appearance O
of O
any O
thing O
going O
against O
us O
, O
and O
take O
effectual O
Measures O
for O
turning O
it O
into O
its O
proper O
Channel O
. O
” O

But O
though O
I O
see O
no O
Reason O
for O
impeaching O
the O
Character O
of O
those O
who O
now O
compose O
the O
Legislation O
or O
Administration O
, O
when O
compared O
with O
their O
Predecessors O
, O
yet O
it O
is O
uncertain O
whether O
they O
will O
endeavour O
, O
and O
more O
so O
, O
whether O
they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
prevent O
the O
injury O
we O
may O
suffer O
from O
unweildy O
Possessions O
. O

I O
have O
not O
built O
my O
Arguments O
upon O
the O
Treachery O
of O
particular O
Men O
, O
or O
even O
the O
Degeneracy O
of O
the O
present O

upon O
the O
Mistakes O
of O
Human O
Nature O
, O

the O
αχμη O
, O
as O
it O
were O
, O
of O

to O
which O
we O
have O
been O
brought O
by O
the O
ordinary O
course O
of O
Things O
, O
and O
peculiar O
Disposition O
of O
Providence O
. O

Bodies O
of O
Men O
, O
alas O
! O

are O
far O
from O
being O
so O
clear-sighted O
, O
as O
they O
themselves O
imagine O

Immediate O
and O
seeming O
, O

particular O

, O
have O
ordinarily O
so O
powerful O
an O
Effect O
on O
the O
most O
uncorrupted O
Part O
of O
them O
, O
as O
bears O
down O
all O
other O
Considerations O
. O

How O
many O
Laws O

to O
Trade O
have O
been O
framed O
with O
a O
sincere O
Intention O
to O
promote O
it O
, O

in O

proved O
hurtful O
to O
it O

so O
that O
those O

to O
repeal O
them O
? O

Perhaps O
if O
all O
the O
Laws O
on O
the O
Subject O

, O
it O
might O
be O
shewn O
that O
the O

that O

When O

I O
sincerely O

The O
French O

had O
they O

had O
as O
little O

as O

and O
if O
their O
Expulsion O

great O

wise O

as O

fill O
their O

able O

that O

were O

However O
fully O
I O
am O
satisfy O
’ O
d O
of O
the O
Truth O
of O
these O
Remarks O
, O
I O
have O
little O
hope O
that O
any O
Body O
of O
Men O
, O
even O
tho O
’ O
they O
should O
assent O
to O
them O
, O
will O
have O
so O
much O
self O
government O
as O
to O
act O
steadily O
on O
the O
Principles O
to O
which O
they O
lead O
. O

We O
all O
agree O
in O
Speculation O
that O
a O
King O
may O
have O
too O
much O
Power O
, O
a O
Peerage O
too O
much O
Influence O
, O
a O
House O
of O
Commons O
too O
much O
Weight O
, O
and O
a O
Multitude O
too O
much O
Liberty O
, O
so O
as O
to O
overturn O
the O
very O
Constitution O
; O
and O
yet O
it O
is O
not O
to O
be O
expected O
that O
any O
one O
of O
them O
will O
refuse O
an O
Accession O
to O
their O
own O
Share O
when O
it O
is O
offered O
, O
or O
surrender O
it O
after O
they O
have O
obtained O
it O
. O

But O
to O
keep O
close O
by O
the O
Subject O
of O
Commerce—How O
little O
Men O
in O
general O
understand O
the O
Nature O
of O
it O
, O
may O
be O
seen O
from O
this O
Circumstance O
; O
that O
many O
Nations O
have O
Laws O
still O
in O
force O
against O
the O
Exportation O
of O
Corn O
. O

Is O
not O
this O
infinitely O
absurd O
? O

What O
signifies O
any O
such O
Law O
. O

If O
we O
import O
more O
from O
any O
Nation O
than O
we O
send O
them O
, O
must O
we O
not O
pay O
the O
Ballance O
, O
or O
give O
up O
the O
Trade O
? O

I O
am O
persuaded O
it O
is O
scarcely O
possible O
to O
make O
any O
Law O
on O
the O
Subject O
of O
Trade O
, O
but O
what O
shall O
do O
more O
harm O
than O
good O
, O
excepting O
those O
which O
are O
directly O
intended O
for O
preventing O
Fraud O
. O

These O
are O
absolutely O
necessary O
and O
highly O
useful O
. O

Of O
the O
same O
Nature O
are O
all O
such O
Laws O
as O
tend O
to O
make O
our O
own O
Commodities O
cheap O
and O
plentiful—But O
those O
which O
aim O
only O
by O
Force O
or O
Prohibition O
to O
keep O
out O
the O
Commodities O
of O
other O
Nations O
, O
have O
an O
inherent O
Weakness O
in O
them O
, O
and O
seldom O
or O
never O
answer O
the O
End O
proposed O
. O

There O
is O
an O
Assertion O
in O
some O
Part O
of O
the O
Writings O
of O
a O
well O
known O
living O
Author O
( O
David B-Person
Hume I-Person
) O
that O
it O
is O
a O
Mistake O
for O
trading O
Nations O
to O
look O
upon O
one O
another O
as O
Rivals O
, O
or O
as O
the O
opposite O
Weights O
in O
a O
Ballance O
; O
so O
that O
the O
Exaltation O
of O
one O
implies O
of O
necessity O
the O
Depression O
of O
the O
other O
. O

He O
says O
, O
he O
is O
persuaded O
of O
the O
contrary O
, O
and O
that O
the O
thriving O
of O
one O
Nation O
is O
a O
Benefit O
, O
instead O
of O
an O
Injury O
, O
to O
all O
that O
are O
about O
them O
. O

The O
Sentiment O
is O
undoubtedly O
noble O
and O
generous O
: O
— O
And O
I O
am O
persuaded O
that O
it O
is O
also O
perfectly O
just O
and O
true O
. O

We O
may O
soon O
be O
satisfied O
of O
it O
, O
by O
going O
back O
to O
the O
Original O
of O
all O
Traffick O
, O
and O
analysing O
it O
in O
the O
following O
plain O
and O
simple O
Manner O
. O

If O
there O
was O
but O
one O
Man O
in O
the O
Earth O
, O
he O
would O
be O
obliged O
to O
dig O
the O
Ground O
for O
his O
food O
, O
and O
dress O
it O
for O
his O
own O
Use O
; O
to O
patch O
together O
something O
or O
another O
for O
his O
cloathing O
; O
to O
build O
himself O
some O
shelter O
from O
the O
Weather O
; O
— O
that O
is O
to O
say—to O
be O
his O
own O
Gardiner O
, O
Cook O
, O
Taylor O
, O
Mason O
; O
— O
and O
in O
short O
every O
Thing O
to O
himself O
. O

If O
there O
were O
one O
or O
two O
more O
joined O
with O
him O
, O
they O
would O
find O
it O
convenient O
to O
distribute O
the O
common O
Labour O
, O
and O
every O
Man O
to O
do O
as O
much O
of O
some O
particular O
Branches O
as O
to O
serve O
the O
whole O
; O
and O
receive O
of O
the O
Labour O
of O
others O
for O
what O
he O
communicated O
of O
his O
own O
. O

Its O
Society O
increases O
: O
the O
same O
general O
Plan O
is O
carried O
on—And O
one O
City O
or O
Nation O
is O
to O
another O
in O
every O
Respect O
the O
same O
, O
as O
one O
Man O
to O
another O
in O
a O
very O
small O
Number O
. O

Therefore O
the O
Radical O
Principle O
of O
all O
Commerce O
is O
this O
: O
As O
much O
as O
one O
Person O
, O
Family O
, O
City O
or O
Nation O
provides O
by O
its O
own O
proper O
Labour O
and O
Application O
of O
the O
common O
Conveniencies O
of O
human O
Life O
, O
more O
than O
it O
uses O
itself O
, O
it O
will O
lay O
up O
or O
dispose O
of O
, O
and O
keep O
under O
some O
instituted O
Sign O
, O
such O
as O
Money O
, O
and O
is O
rich O
just O
to O
that O
Degree O
and O
no O
more O
. O

If O
it O
provides O
less O
than O
it O
uses O
, O
no O
Circumstance O
imaginable O
, O
and O
least O
of O
all O
extensive O
Possessions O
, O
will O
prevent O
it O
from O
being O
poor O
. O

Now O
let O
me O
ask O
, O
does O
the O
Industry O
and O
Activity O
of O
one O
Nation O
hinder O
another O
from O
working O
diligently O
? O

Very O
far O
from O
it O
. O

It O
rather O
serves O
to O
excite O
them O
by O
Imitation O
. O

There O
cannot O
be O
the O
least O
Interference O
but O
when O
they O
are O
both O
employed O
in O
producing O
Commodities O
of O
the O
same O
Kind O
; O
and O
then O
to O
be O
sure O
upon O
the O
Supposition O
of O
equal O
natural O
Advantages O
, O
the O
most O
sober O
and O
diligent O
People O
will O
send O
them O
to O
Market O
cheapest O
, O
and O
carry O
away O
the O
Trade O
. O

But O
it O
is O
in O
vain O
to O
complain O
in O
this O
Case O
. O

The O
Remedy O
is O
only O
in O
ourselves O
: O
and O
the O
Commodities O
of O
Life O
are O
so O
various O
and O
innumerable O
, O
that O
every O
Country O
affords O
Opportunities O
to O
its O
Inhabitants O
of O
securing O
their O
own O
Prosperity O
, O
and O
contributing O
to O
that O
of O
the O
whole O
Earth O
. O

The O
only O
proper O
and O
just O
, O
and O
indeed O
the O
only O
effectual O
Way O
, O
of O
one O
Nation O
out-stripping O
another O
, O
is O
by O
out O
working O
them O
. O

When O
instead O
of O
this O
, O
we O
only O
endeavour O
to O
hinder O
them O
from O
working O
, O
or O
to O
destroy O
them O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
little O
less O
absurd O
than O
the O
Measure O
of O
the O
Savage O
, O
who O
meeting O
a O
Man O
wiser O
than O
himself O
, O
put O
him O
to O
Death O
, O
that O
he O
might O
plunder O
him O
of O
his O
Wisdom O
. O

Nothing O
appears O
to O
me O
more O
ridiculous O
and O
pusillanimous O
than O
what O
we O
meet O
with O
almost O
every O
Day O
in O
our O
News-papers O
, O
since O
the O
late O
Peace O
. O

If O
any O
French O
Ships O
are O
seen O
at O
Sea O
, O
immediately O
the O
Alarm O
is O
sounded O
, O
and O
the O
Ruin O
of O
Britain B-Organization
is O
at O
hand O
. O

Capt O
. O
— O
— O
in O
his O
Passage O
met O
with O
— O
— O
French O
Ships O
in O
— O
— O
Latitude O
, O
and O
they O
seemed O
to O
be O
steering O
their O
Course O
for O
the O
Gulf B-Location
of I-Location
Darien I-Location
, O
where O
, O
if O
they O
effect O
a O
Settlement O
they O
will O
carry O
away O
the O
whole O
Riches O
of O
South-America B-Location
. O

— O
Great O
Preparations O
are O
making O
by O
the O
French O
for O
fishing O
this O
Season O
on O
the O
Banks O
of O
Newfoundland B-Location
; O
and O
it O
is O
thought O
they O
will O
have O
more O
Ships O
in O
that O
Trade O
than O
ever O
they O
had O
before O
. O

— O
The O
French O
seem O
resolved O
to O
establish O
a O
Settlement O
and O
Forts O
on O
some O
Parts O
of O
the O
African B-Location
Coast I-Location
, O
and O
if O
they O
do O
, O
they O
will O
ingross O
the O
whole O
Negro O
Trade O
entirely O
to O
themselves O
. O

When O
I O
read O
such O
Reflections O
as O
these O
, O
I O
sigh O
, O
and O
say O
to O
myself O
, O
Oh O
, O
my O
poor O
Country B-Organization
! O

Is O
there O
no O
Way O
of O
preserving O
thee O
from O
Destruction O
but O
by O
depriving O
the O
whole O
French B-Organization
Nation I-Organization
of O
their O
Senses O
? O

If O
this O
is O
the O
Case O
, O
why O
should O
we O
mince O
the O
matter O
? O

Let O
us O
aim O
a O
Blow O
at O
the O
Root O
. O

Let O
us O
rise O
as O
one O
Man O
, O
pass O
the O
Straits O
of O
Dover B-Location
, O
and O
without O
staying O
to O
demolish O
Dunkirk B-Location
, O
let O
us O
drive O
them O
all O
before O
us O
, O
young O
and O
old O
, O
Male O
and O
Female O
, O
and O
drown O
them O
in O
the O
Mediterranean B-Location
Sea I-Location
. O

If O
this O
Discourse O
had O
not O
been O
drawn O
out O
to O
a O
greater O
Length O
than O
I O
intended O
, O
it O
might O
have O
been O
proper O
to O
have O
considered O
a O
little O
how O
the O
Matter O
has O
appeared O
in O
Fact O
. O

Every O
Person O
acquainted O
with O
History O
must O
acknowledge O
, O
that O
the O
Places O
in O
antient O
Times O
, O
remarkable O
for O
Trade O
, O
had O
but O
small O
Territories O
. O

Tyre B-Location
had O
a O
very O
limited O
Territory O
. O

I O
cannot O
be O
precise O
as O
to O
its O
Extent O
, O
but O
am O
certain O
it O
was O
not O
greater O
than O
two O
or O
three O
Shires O
in O
England B-Location
. O

Carthage B-Location
, O
the O
Daughter O
of O
Tyre B-Location
, O
had O
but O
little O
Room O
for O
several O
Ages O
; O
but O
growing O
rich O
and O
powerful O
by O
Commerce O
, O
she O
attempted O
to O
extend O
her O
Conquests O
, O
and O
by O
doing O
so O
, O
brought O
on O
her O
own O
Destruction O
. O

At O
this O
present O
Time O
, O
excepting O
France B-Location
and O
England B-Location
, O
the O
other O
Places O
in O
Europe B-Location
where O
Trade O
flourishes O
, O
have O
but O
very O
narrow O
Limits O
. O

The O
Dutch O
, O
who O
as O
a O
Nation B-Organization
have O
deviated O
as O
little O
from O
the O
Maxims O
of O
sound O
Policy O
as O
any O
People O
on O
Earth O
, O
do O
not O
seem O
at O
all O
covetous O
of O
much O
Ground O
, O
or O
many O
distant O
Settlements O
; O
yet O
they O
are O
the O
richest O
People O
in O
Europe B-Location
, O
and O
for O
their O
Numbers O
the O
strongest O
; O
just O
because O
these O
Numbers O
are O
inclosed O
in O
so O
narrow O
Bounds O
. O

They O
have O
indeed O
very O
valuable O
Settlements O
in O
the O
East B-Location
Indies I-Location
, O
from O
this O
single O
Circumstance O
, O
that O
they O
ingross O
the O
Spice O
Trade O
. O

But O
whatever O
it O
be O
to O
them O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
granted O
by O
all O
who O
understand O
the O
Subject O
, O
that O
the O
East-India O
Trade O
is O
hurtful O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
Europe B-Location
. O

I O
fancy O
to O
myself O
that O
some O
of O
my O
Mercantile O
Readers O
will O
have O
long O
ago O
perceived O
that O
I O
am O
no O
Merchant O
, O
and O
therefore O
will O
be O
saying O
within O
themselves O
in O
the O
most O
contemptuous O
Manner O
, O
What O
has O
this O
Author O
to O
do O
with O
Trade O
? O

How O
can O
he O
take O
upon O
him O
to O
write O
upon O
a O
Subject O
he O
does O
not O
understand O
? O

I O
am O
sure O
if O
I O
was O
a O
Merchant O
, O
I O
should O
reckon O
myself O
utterly O
unqualified O
for O
speaking O
on O
the O
Question O
which O
stands O
at O
the O
Head O
of O
my O
Paper O
. O

Actual O
Merchants O
are O
so O
ingrossed O
by O
the O
Gain O
or O
Loss O
of O
their O
own O
particular O
Branches O
, O
that O
it O
is O
impossible O
for O
them O
to O
perceive O
the O
Hurt O
or O
Benefit O
of O
the O
whole O
Body O
. O

These O
proceed O
upon O
general O
principles O
, O
on O
which O
any O
Man O
of O
common O
Understanding O
may O
write O
clearly O
, O
and O
those O
who O
are O
not O
Traders O
themselves O
must O
be O
supposed O
to O
judge O
with O
the O
greatest O
Impartiality O
. O

A O
Man O
who O
is O
in O
the O
Middle O
of O
a O
Crowd O
, O
will O
not O
perceive O
so O
distinctly O
, O
half O
what O
is O
doing O
in O
five O
different O
Parts O
of O
it O
, O
or O
whither O
the O
whole O
is O
tending O
, O
as O
he O
who O
is O
removed O
at O
a O
little O
distance O
from O
it O
, O
and O
by O
his O
Situation O
above O
it O
. O

I O
remember O
Dr B-Person
. I-Person

Burnet I-Person
says O
somewhere O
, O
that O
when O
the O
new-modelling O
the O
Government O
at O
the O
Revolution O
was O
upon O
the O
Tapis O
, O
of O
all O
who O
wrote O
or O
spoke O
on O
that O
Subject O
, O
none O
were O
so O
much O
bewilder O
’ O
d O
as O
the O
Lawyers O
. O

He O
seems O
to O
be O
surpriz O
’ O
d O
at O
this O
. O

But O
it O
was O
no O
Wonder O
at O
all O
. O

For O
Lawyers O
were O
so O
accustomed O
to O
think O
of O
the O
Force O
of O
particular O
Statutes O
, O
that O
they O
were O
every O
now O
and O
then O
saying O
, O
that O
such O
and O
such O
Measures O
were O
against O
Law O
: O
Than O
which O
nothing O
could O
be O
more O
ridiculous O
. O

For O
what O
signified O
all O
former O
Laws O
, O
when O
the O
Government B-Organization
was O
to O
be O
resettled O
from O
the O
very O
Foundation O
. O

It O
was O
easy O
to O
see O
, O
that O
if O
the O
Revolutioners O
were O
able O
to O
keep O
their O
Ground O
, O
they O
would O
justify O
themselves O
: O
Whereas O
if O
the O
banish O
’ O
d O
Prince B-Person
had O
recover O
’ O
d O
Possession O
, O
he O
would O
have O
hanged O
as O
many O
as O
he O
pleased O
of O
his O
Opposers O
, O
though O
they O
had O
never O
broke O
a O
Law O
in O
their O
Lives O
, O
any O
otherwise O
than O
by O
sending O
him O
away O
. O

To O
draw O
towards O
a O
Conclusion O
: O
I O
am O
desirous O
of O
having O
the O
Question O
examin O
’ O
d O
with O
Care O
; O
and O
whether O
this O
insatiable O
Desire O
in O
our O
Nation B-Organization
of O
such O
extensive O
Territories O
, O
as O
must O
be O
measured O
by O
the O
Heavens O
, O
and O
probably O
never O
will O
be O
perambulated O
, O
be O
not O
like O
all O
selfish O
interested O
Affections O
in O
Individuals O
, O
Destruction O
to O
ourselves O
. O

If O
my O
Fears O
are O
quite O
groundless O
, O
so O
much O
the O
better O
for O
us O
and O
our O
Posterity O
: O
If O
otherwise O
, O
it O
were O
to O
be O
wish O
’ O
d O
that O
the O
best O
Means O
were O
pointed O
out O
for O
retarding O
our O
Ruin O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
. O

If O
any O
have O
been O
so O
far O
moved O
by O
what O
I O
have O
said O
as O
to O
wish O
me O
to O
proceed O
in O
mentioning O
these O
Means O
; O
I O
answer O
, O
let O
us O
be O
well O
convinced O
that O
the O
Danger O
is O
real O
, O
before O
we O
come O
to O
Particulars O
. O

In O
general O
however O
, O
the O
Remedies O
must O
be O
of O
the O
same O
Nature O
as O
are O
prescribed O
by O
Physicians O
, O
when O
the O
Patient O
is O
under O
a O
bad O
Habit O
, O
without O
any O
acute O
Disorder O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
, O
slow O
and O
alterative O
, O
but O
radical O
and O
fundamental O
. O

They O
must O
be O
such O
as O
have O
an O
Influence O
upon O
the O
Principles O
and O
Manners O
of O
the O
People O
, O
and O
the O
Cultivation O
of O
the O
Soil O
. O

The O
first O
is O
chiefly O
necessary O
, O
and O
will O
produce O
the O
other O
as O
its O
Effect O
. O

Yet O
Agriculture O
ought O
to O
be O
the O
Object O
of O
immediate O
Attention O
, O
as O
it O
will O
promote O
Health O
and O
Sobriety O
among O
those O
who O
are O
employed O
in O
it O
; O
Numbers O
of O
People O
to O
fill O
the O
Cities O
, O
and O
abundance O
of O
Provision O
for O
their O
daily O
Support O
. O

It O
is O
demonstrable O
that O
all O
our O
great O
Cities O
are O
supplied O
with O
Inhabitants O
from O
the O
Country B-Location
, O
and O
therefore O
whatever O
tends O
to O
the O
depopulating O
of O
the O
distant O
Parts O
, O
will O
in O
the O
End O
prove O
Destruction O
not O
only O
to O
themselves O
, O
but O
the O
whole O
. O

FINIS O

1 O
It O
is O
probable O
this O
Observation O
will O
appear O
somewhat O
strange O
to O
many O
, O
because O
it O
is O
a O
little O
out O
of O
the O
common O
Road O
. O

But O
if O
they O
will O
reflect O
with O
Attention O
and O
Accuracy O
, O
they O
will O
find O
it O
conclusive O
in O
point O
of O
Reasoning O
, O
and O
confirmed O
by O
Experience O
, O
in O
innumerable O
Instances O
. O

Remember O
, O
the O
Supposition O
is O
, O
that O
the O
Excess O
is O
prejudicial O
; O
now O
does O
it O
not O
follow O
that O
the O
greater O
the O
Excess O
, O
the O
greater O
the O
Prejudice O
? O

Try O
this O
on O
every O
Subject O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
found O
to O
hold O
. O

If O
a O
man O
is O
tempted O
to O
Luxury O
, O
Softness O
, O
and O
Indulgence O
, O
by O
an O
affluent O
Fortune O
; O
the O
greater O
the O
Fortune O
, O
the O
more O
whimsical O
, O
extravagant O
, O
and O
endless O
his O
Desires O
. O

If O
a O
man O
happens O
to O
get O
more O
Applause O
than O
he O
is O
able O
to O
bear O
, O
the O
greater O
Quantity O
of O
Incense O
you O
offer O
to O
him O
, O
the O
sooner O
is O
his O
Head O
turned O
, O
and O
the O
greater O
is O
his O
Intoxication O
. O

If O
a O
General O
is O
incommoded O
in O
the O
Day O
of O
Battle O
by O
the O
very O
Numbers O
of O
his O
own O
Army O
, O
the O
greater O
the O
Multitude O
, O
the O
more O
inexpressible O
the O
Confusion O
; O
the O
more O
sudden O
and O
dreadful O
his O
Defeat O
. O
2 O
The O
Severities O
exercised O
upon O
the O
Indians O
, O
have O
certainly O
given O
much O
pain O
to O
Princes O
of O
humanity O
, O
among O
us O
, O
who O
hear O
of O
them O
, O
as O
they O
appear O
to O
have O
given O
to O
several O
of O
our O
Officers O
who O
were O
obliged O
by O
their O
Orders O
to O
commit O
them O
. O

The O
great O
absurdity O
of O
them O
in O
point O
of O
Policy O
will O
plainly O
appear O
, O
by O
comparing O
the O
State O
of O
these O
People O
with O
our O
own O
. O

There O
are O
three O
great O
Stages O
in O
the O
Progress O
of O
human O
Society O
. O

The O
First O
is O
, O
the O
Savage O
State O
, O
in O
which O
Men O
subsist O
by O
Hunting O
, O
and O
need O
by O
far O
the O
greatest O
Quantity O
of O
Ground O
. O

The O
Second O
, O
the O
Pastoral O
Life O
; O
which O
needs O
considerably O
less O
than O
the O
former O
, O
but O
still O
a O
good O
deal O
. O

— O
And O
the O
Last O
, O
is O
that O
of O
Agriculture O
and O
Commerce O
, O
which O
needs O
least O
of O
all O
. O

Now O
the O
Indians O
are O
in O
the O
first O
State O
; O
we O
are O
in O
the O
last O
; O
and O
yet O
we O
are O
never O
satisfied O
, O
but O
still O
driving O
them O
into O
Corners O
, O
and O
obliging O
them O
to O
cede O
vast O
Tracts O
, O
which O
are O
necessary O
to O
them O
, O
and O
which O
possessed O
by O
them O
, O
might O
be O
of O
some O
use O
to O
us O
, O
but O
which O
without O
them O
can O
be O
of O
no O
Service O
to O
us O
at O
all O
. O

This O
Cruelty O
however O
, O
it O
will O
be O
said O
, O
tho O
’ O
undesirable O
, O
was O
necessary O
, O
because O
they O
would O
not O
let O
us O
alone O
. O

It O
is O
impossible O
to O
believe O
it O
. O

No O
Briton O
at O
this O
Time O
hath O
so O
much O
to O
say O
with O
them O
as O
Sir O
William B-Person
Johnson I-Person
; O
and O
it O
is O
evident O
he O
acquired O
his O
Influence O
, O
not O
by O
Cruelty O
, O
but O
by O
Honesty O
and O
Mercy O
