On O

, O
1765 O
, O
shortly O
after O
news O
of O
the O
passage O
of O
the O
Stamp O

reached O
Boston B-Location
, O
the O
Massachusetts B-Organization
House I-Organization
of I-Organization

issued O
a O
circular O
letter O
to O
the O

calling O
upon O
them O
to O

In O
October O
, O
twenty-seven O
delegates O
from O
nine O
colonies O
met O
in O
New B-Location
York I-Location

City I-Location
Hall I-Location
( O
the O
building O
later O
known O
as O
Federal B-Location

in O
what O
one O
member O
called O
“ O
an O
Assembly B-Organization
of O
the O
greatest O
Ability O
I O
ever O
Yet O
saw O

” O

Although O
the O
Stamp B-Organization
Act I-Organization
Congress I-Organization
declared O
that O
the O
colonists O
owed O
“ O
all O
due O
Subordination O
to O
that O
August O
Body O
the O
Parliament B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great I-Organization
Britain I-Organization
, O
” O
it O
also O
stated O
that O
“ O
it O
is O
inseparably O
essential O
to O
the O
Freedom O
of O
a O
People O
, O
and O
the O
undoubted O
Right O
of O
Englishmen O
, O
that O
no O
Taxes O
should O
be O
imposed O
on O
them O
, O
but O
with O
their O
own O
Consent O
, O
given O
personally O
, O
or O
by O
their O
Representatives B-Organization

” O

And O
since O
“ O
the O
People O
of O
these O
Colonies O
are O
not O
, O
and O
from O
their O
local O
Circumstances O
cannot O
be O

Represented O
in O
the O
House B-Organization
of I-Organization

in I-Organization
Great I-Organization
Britain I-Organization
, O
” O
that O
consent O
could O
only O
be O
given O
by O
persons O
who O
were O
chosen O
by O
themselves O
and O
who O
served O
in O
their O
respective O
provincial O
legislatures O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
in O
England B-Location
, O
George B-Person
III I-Person
had O
replaced O
Grenville O
’ O
s O
ministry B-Organization
in O
July O
with O
one O
headed O
by O
Lord B-Person
Rockingham I-Person
that O
was O
promptly O
faced O
with O
the O
task O
of O
repealing O
the O
Stamp O
Act O
, O
now O
viewed O
as O
insupportable O
in O
the O
face O
of O
opposition O
in O
the O
colonies B-Location
and O
at O
home O
. O

It O
would O
not O
be O
easy O
. O

As O
Benjamin B-Person
Franklin I-Person
explained O
to O
Lord B-Person
Dartmouth I-Person
, O
the O
newly O
appointed O
head O
of O
the O
Board B-Organization
of I-Organization
Trade I-Organization
, O
repeal O
“ O

be O

up O

of O

” O

Once O
the O
British B-Organization
government I-Organization
engaged O
Parliament B-Organization
as O
the O
instrument O
for O
reforming O
the O
empire B-Organization
, O
it O
had O
raised O
the O
stakes O
to O
the O
highest O
possible O
level O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
today O
to O
appreciate O
the O
awe O
and O
wonder O
with O
which O
nearly O
all O
Englishmen O
held O
Parliament B-Organization
in O
the O
eighteenth O
century O
. O

Opposing O
royal O
power O
on O
behalf O
of O
liberty O
was O
what O
good O
Whigs O
did O
. O

But O
opposing O
Parliament B-Organization
—the O
bulwark O
that O
stood O
between O
the O
people O
and O
monarchical O
tyranny—was O
altogether O
a O
different O
matter O
. O

As O
the O
locus O
of O
sovereignty O
in O
the O
British O
constitution O
, O
Parliament B-Organization
was O
seen O
by O
most O
Englishmen O
to O
be O
beyond O
challenge O
. O

Unlike O
the O
American O
Bill O
of O
Rights O
, O
which O
restrains O
the O
entire O
federal B-Organization
government I-Organization
, O
including O
the O
Congress B-Organization
, O
the O
English O
Bill O
of O
Rights O
placed O
limits O
solely O
on O
the O
Crown B-Organization
. O

Being O
the O
creator O
of O
the O
Bill O
of O
Rights O
, O
Parliament B-Organization
retained O
the O
power O
to O
rescind O
these O
rights O
: O
the O
king B-Organization
could O
not O
dispence O
with O
or O
suspend O
laws O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
but O
Parliament B-Organization
could O
. O

Forcing O
this O
imposing O
body O
to O
disavow O
something O
it O
had O
done O
ran O
deeply O
against O
the O
grain O
of O
Whig O
thinking O
. O

The O
Rockingham B-Organization
ministry I-Organization
decided O
to O
call O
upon O
Franklin B-Person
, O
the O
most O
famous O
American O
in O
London B-Location
, O
to O
provide O
cover O
for O
Parliament B-Organization
’ O
s O
repeal O
of O
the O
Stamp O
Act O

His O
three-hour O
testimony O
before O
the O
House B-Organization
of I-Organization
Commons I-Organization
on O
February O
13 O
, O
1766 O
, O
was O
effective O
, O
and O
the O
next O
month O
Parliament B-Organization
undid O
what O
it O
had O
done O
the O
previous O
year O
. O

To O
ease O
the O
pain O
of O
this O
humiliating O
retreat O
, O
it O
accompanied O
its O
repeal O
of O
the O
Stamp O
Act O
with O
a O
Declaratory O
Act O
which O
stated O
that O
the O
Parliament B-Organization
had O
full O
authority O
to O
bind O
the O
colonists O
“ O
in O
all O
Cases O
whatsoever O
. O

If O
the O
British B-Organization
government I-Organization
was O
unable O
to O
collect O
any O
actual O
stamp O
taxes O
, O
at O
least O
it O
had O
made O
the O
point O
that O
it O
had O
the O
right O

Q O

Do O
the O
Americans O
pay O
any O
considerable O
taxes O
among O
themselves O
? O

A O
. O

Certainly O
many O
, O
and O
very O
heavy O
taxes O
. O

Q O
. O

What O
are O
the O
present O
taxes O
in O
Pennsylvania B-Location
, O
laid O
by O
the O
laws O
of O
the O
Colony B-Organization
? O

A O
. O

There O
are O
taxes O
on O
all O
estates O
real O
and O
personal O
, O
a O
poll O
tax O
, O
a O
tax O
on O
all O
offices O

professions O

trades O
and O
businesses O
, O
according O
to O
their O
profits O
; O
an O
excise O
on O
all O
wine O

and O
other O
spirits O
; O
and O
a O
duty O
of O
Ten O
Pounds O
per O
head O
on O
all O
Negroes O
imported O
, O
with O
some O
other O
duties O
. O

Q O
. O

For O
what O
purposes O
are O
those O
taxes O
laid O
? O

A O
. O

For O
the O
support O
of O
the O
civil O
and O
military O
establishments O
of O
the O
country B-Organization
, O
and O
to O
discharge O
the O
heavy O
debt O
contracted O
in O
the O
last O
war O
. O

Q O
. O

How O
long O
are O
those O
taxes O
to O
continue O
? O

A O
. O

Those O
for O
discharging O
the O
debt O
are O
to O
continue O
till O
1772 O
, O
and O
longer O
, O
if O
the O
debt O
should O
not O
be O
then O
all O
discharged O
. O

The O
others O
must O
always O
continue O
. O

Q O
. O

Was O
it O
not O
expected O
that O
the O
debt O
would O
have O
been O
sooner O
discharged O
? O

A O
. O

It O
was O
, O
when O
the O
peace O
was O
made O
with O
France B-Organization
and O
Spain— B-Organization
But O
a O
fresh O
war O
breaking O
out O
with O
the O
Indians O
, O
a O
fresh O
load O
of O
debt O
was O
incurred O
, O
and O
the O
taxes O
, O
of O
course O
, O
continued O
longer O
by O
a O
new O
law O
. O

Q O
. O

Are O
not O
all O
the O
people O
very O
able O
to O
pay O
those O
taxes O
? O

A O
. O

No O
. O

The O
frontier O
counties O
, O
all O
along O
the O
continent B-Location
, O
having O
been O
frequently O
ravaged O
by O
the O
enemy O
, O
and O
greatly O
impoverished O
, O
are O
able O
to O
pay O
very O
little O
tax O
. O

And O
therefore O
, O
in O
consideration O
of O
their O
distresses O
, O
our O
late O
tax O
laws O
do O
expresly O
favour O
those O
counties O
, O
excusing O
the O
sufferers O
; O
and O
I O
suppose O
the O
same O
is O
done O
in O
other O
governments O
. O

Q O
. O

Are O
not O
you O
concerned O
in O
the O
management O
of O
the O
Post-Office B-Organization
in O
America B-Location
? O

A O
. O

Yes O

I O
am O
Deputy B-Organization
Post-Master I-Organization
General I-Organization
of O
North-America B-Location
. O

Q O
. O

Don O
’ O
t O
you O
think O
the O
distribution O
of O
stamps O
, O
by O
post O
, O
to O
all O
the O
inhabitants O
, O
very O
practicable O
, O
if O
there O
was O
no O
opposition O
? O

A O
. O

The O
posts O
only O
go O
along O
the O
sea O
coasts O
; O
they O
do O
not O
, O
except O
in O
a O
few O
instances O
, O
go O
back O
into O
the O
country B-Location
; O
and O
if O
they O
did O
, O
sending O
for O
stamps O
by O
post O
would O
occasion O
an O
expence O
of O
postage O
, O
amounting O
, O
in O
many O
cases O
, O
to O
much O
more O
than O
that O
of O
the O
stamps O
themselves O
. O

Q O
. O

Are O
you O
acquainted O
with O
Newfoundland B-Location
? O

A O
. O

I O
never O
was O
there O
. O

Q O
. O

Do O
you O
know O
whether O
there O
are O
any O
post O
roads O
on O
that O
island O
? O

A O
. O

I O
have O
heard O
that O
there O
are O
no O
roads O
at O
all O
; O
but O
that O
the O
communication O
between O
one O
settlement O
and O
another O
is O
by O
sea O
only O
. O

Q O
. O

Can O
you O
dispense O
the O
stamps O
by O
post O
in O
Canada B-Location
? O

A O
. O

There O
is O
only O
a O
post O
between O
Montreal B-Location
and O
Quebec B-Location
. O

The O
inhabitants O
live O
so O
scattered O
and O
remote O
from O
each O
other O
, O
in O
that O
vast O
country B-Location
, O
that O
posts O
cannot O
be O
supported O
among O
them O
, O
and O
therefore O
they O
cannot O
get O
stamps O
per O
post O
. O

The O
English B-Location
Colonies I-Location
too O
, O
along O
the O
frontiers O
, O
are O
very O
thinly O
settled O
. O

Q O
. O

From O
the O
thinness O
of O
the O
back O
settlements O
, O
would O
not O
the O
stamp-act O
be O
extreamly O
inconvenient O
to O
the O
inhabitants O
, O
if O
executed O
? O

A O
. O

To O
be O
sure O
it O
would O
; O
as O
many O
of O
the O
inhabitants O
could O
not O
get O
stamps O
when O
they O
had O
occasion O
for O
them O
, O
without O
taking O
long O
journeys O
, O
and O
spending O
perhaps O
Three O
or O
Four O
Pounds O
, O
that O
the O
Crown B-Organization
might O
get O
Sixpence O
. O

Q O
. O

Are O
not O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
, O
from O
their O
circumstances O
, O
very O
able O
to O
pay O
the O
stamp O
duty O
? O

A O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
there O
is O
not O
gold O
and O
silver O
enough O
in O
the O
Colonies B-Location
to O
pay O
the O
stamp O
duty O
for O
one O
year O
. O

Q O
. O

Don O
’ O
t O
you O
know O
that O
the O
money O
arising O
from O
the O
stamps O
was O
all O
to O
be O
laid O
out O
in O
America B-Location
? O

A O
. O

I O
know O
it O
is O
appropriated O
by O
the O
act O
to O
the O
American O
service O
; O
but O
it O
will O
be O
spent O
in O
the O
conquered O
Colonies B-Location
, O
where O
the O
soldiers O
are O
, O
not O
in O
the O
Colonies B-Location
that O
pay O
it O
. O

Q O
. O

Is O
there O
not O
a O
ballance O
of O
trade O
due O
from O
the O
Colonies B-Location
where O
the O
troops O
are O
posted O
, O
that O
will O
bring O
back O
the O
money O
to O
the O
old B-Organization
Colonies I-Organization
? O

A O
. O

I O
think O
not O
. O

I O
believe O
very O
little O
would O
come O
back O
. O

I O
know O
of O
no O
trade O
likely O
to O
bring O
it O
back O
. O

I O
think O
it O
would O
come O
from O
the O
Colonies B-Location
where O
it O
was O
spent O
directly O
to O
England B-Organization
; O
for O
I O
have O
always O
observed O
, O
that O
in O
every O
Colony O
the O
more O
plenty O
the O
means O
of O
remittance O
to O
England B-Organization
, O
the O
more O
goods O
are O
sent O
for O
, O
and O
the O
more O
trade O
with O
England B-Organization
carried O
on O
. O

Q O
. O

What O
number O
of O
white O
inhabitants O
do O
you O
think O
there O
are O
in O
Pennsylvania B-Person
? O

A O
. O

I O
suppose O
there O
may O
be O
about O
160,000 O
. O

Q O
. O

What O
number O
of O
them O
are O
Quakers O
? O

A O
. O

Perhaps O
a O
third O
. O

Q O
. O

What O
number O
of O
Germans O
? O

A O
. O

Perhaps O
another O
third O
; O
but O
I O
cannot O
speak O
with O
certainty O
. O

Q O
. O

Have O
any O
number O
of O
the O
Germans O
seen O
service O
, O
as O
soldiers O
, O
in O
Europe B-Location
? O

A O
. O

Yes O
, O
— O
many O
of O
them O
, O
both O
in O
Europe B-Location
and O
America B-Location
. O

Q O
. O

Are O
they O
as O
much O
dissatisfied O
with O
the O
stamp O
duty O
as O
the O
English O
? O

A O
. O

Yes O
, O
and O
more O
; O
and O
with O
reason O
, O
as O
their O
stamps O
are O
, O
in O
many O
cases O
, O
to O
be O
double O
. O

Q O
. O

How O
many O
white O
men O
do O
you O
suppose O
there O
are O
in O
North-America B-Location
? O

A O
. O

About O
300,000 O
, O
from O
sixteen O
to O
sixty O
years O
of O
age O
. O

Q O
. O

What O
may O
be O
the O
amount O
of O
one O
year O
’ O
s O
imports O
into O
Pennsylvania B-Location
from O
Britain B-Location
? O

A O
. O

I O
have O
been O
informed O
that O
our O
merchants O
compute O
the O
imports O
from O
Britain B-Location
to O
be O
above O
500,000 O
Pounds O
. O

Q O
. O

What O
may O
be O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
produce O
of O
your O
province O
exported O
to O
Britain B-Location
? O

A O
. O

It O
must O
be O
small O
, O
as O
we O
produce O
little O
that O
is O
wanted O
in O
Britain B-Location
. O

I O
suppose O
it O
cannot O
exceed O
40,000 O
Pounds O
. O

Q O
. O

How O
then O
do O
you O
pay O
the O
ballance O
? O

A O
. O

The O
ballance O
is O
paid O
by O
our O
produce O
carried O
to O
the O
West-Indies B-Location
, O
and O
sold O
in O
our O
own O
islands B-Location
, O
or O
to O
the O
French O
, O
Spaniards O
, O
Danes O
and O
Dutch O
; O
by O
the O
same O
carried O
to O
other O
colonies O
in O
North-America B-Location
, O
as O
to O
New-England B-Location
, O
Nova-Scotia B-Location
, O
Newfoundland B-Location
, O
Carolina B-Location
and O
Georgia B-Location
; O
by O
the O
same O
carried O
to O
different O
parts O
of O
Europe B-Location
, O
as O
Spain B-Location
, O
Portugal B-Location
and O
Italy B-Location
. O

In O
all O
which O
places O
we O
receive O
either O
money O
, O
bills O
of O
exchange O
, O
or O
commodities O
that O
suit O
for O
remittance O
to O
Britain B-Organization
; O
which O
, O
together O
with O
all O
the O
profits O
on O
the O
industry O
of O
our O
merchants O
and O
mariners O
, O
arising O
in O
those O
circuitous O
voyages O
, O
and O
the O
freights O
made O
by O
their O
ships O
, O
center O
finally O
in O

to O
discharge O
the O

Q O

Have O
you O
heard O
of O
any O
difficulties O
lately O
laid O
on O
the O
Spanish O
trade O
? O

A O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
have O
heard O
that O
it O
has O
been O
greatly O
obstructed O
by O
some O
new O
regulations O
, O
and O
by O
the O
English O
men O
of O
war O
and O
cutters O
stationed O
all O
along O
the O
coast B-Location
in I-Location
America I-Location
. O

Q O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
it O
right O
that O
America B-Location
should O
be O
protected O
by O
this O
country B-Organization
, O
and O
pay O
no O
part O
of O
the O
expence O
? O

A O
. O

That O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O

The O
Colonies B-Organization
raised O
, O
cloathed O
and O
paid O
, O
during O
the O
last O
war O
, O
near O
25000 O
men O
, O
and O
spent O
many O
millions O
. O

Q O
. O

Were O
you O
not O
reimbursed O
by O
parliament B-Organization
? O

A O
. O

We O
were O
only O
reimbursed O
what O
, O
in O
your O
opinion O
, O
we O
had O
advanced O
beyond O
our O
proportion O
, O
or O
beyond O
what O
might O
reasonably O
be O
expected O
from O
us O
; O
and O
it O
was O
a O
very O
small O
part O
of O
what O
we O
spent O
. O

Pennsylvania B-Organization
, O
in O
particular O
, O
disbursed O
about O
500,000 O
Pounds O
, O
and O
the O
reimbursements O
, O
in O
the O
whole O
, O
did O
not O
exceed O
60,000 O
Pounds O
. O

Q O
. O

You O
have O
said O
that O
you O
pay O
heavy O
taxes O
in O
Pennsylvania B-Location
; O
what O
do O
they O
amount O
to O
in O
the O
Pound O
? O

A O
. O

The O
tax O
on O
all O
estates O
, O
real O
and O
personal O
, O
is O
Eighteen O
Pence O
in O
the O
Pound O
, O
fully O
rated O
; O
and O
the O
tax O
on O
the O
profits O
of O
trades O
and O
professions O
, O
with O
other O
taxes O
, O
do O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
make O
full O
Half O
a O
Crown O
in O
the O
Pound O

Q O
. O

Do O
you O
know O
any O
thing O
of O
the O
rate O
of O

in O
Pennsylvania B-Location
, O
and O
whether O
it O
is O
fallen O
lately O
? O

A O
. O

It O
is O
commonly O
from O
170 O
to O
175 O
. O

I O
have O
heard O
that O
it O
has O
fallen O
lately O
from O
175 O
to O
162 O
and O
a O
half O
, O
owing O
, O
I O
suppose O
, O
to O
their O
lessening O
their O
orders O
for O
goods O
; O
and O
when O
their O
debts O
to O
this O
country B-Organization
are O
paid O
, O
I O
think O
the O
exchange O
will O
probably O
be O
at O
par O
. O

Q O
. O

Do O
not O
you O
think O
the O
people O
of O
America B-Location
would O
submit O
to O
pay O
the O
stamp O
duty O
, O
if O
it O
was O
moderated O
? O

A O
. O

No O
, O
never O
, O
unless O
compelled O
by O
force O
of O
arms O
. O

Q O
. O

Are O
not O
the O
taxes O
in O
Pennsylvania B-Location
laid O
on O
unequally O
, O
in O
order O
to O
burthen O
the O
English O
trade O
, O
particularly O
the O
tax O
on O
professions O
and O
business O
? O

A O
. O

It O
is O
not O
more O
burthensome O
in O
proportion O
than O
the O
tax O
on O
lands O
. O

It O
is O
intended O
, O
and O
supposed O
to O
take O
an O
equal O
proportion O
of O

Q O

How O
is O
the O
assembly B-Organization
composed O
? O

Of O
what O
kinds O
of O
people O
are O
the O
members O

landholders O
or O

? O

A O

It O
is O
composed O
of O
landholders O

merchants O

Q O

Are O
not O
the O

I O
believe O
they O
are O

Q O

Do O
not O
they O
, O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
shift O
the O
tax O
off O
from O
the O
land O
, O
to O
ease O
that O
, O
and O
lay O
the O

heavier O
on O

I O
have O
never O
understood O
it O
so O

I O
never O
heard O
such O
a O
thing O
suggested O

And O
indeed O
an O
attempt O
of O
that O
kind O
could O
answer O
no O
purpose O

The O

or O
trader O
is O
always O
skilled O
in O
figures O
, O
and O
ready O
with O
his O
pen O
and O
ink O
. O

If O
unequal O
burthens O
are O
laid O
on O
his O
trade O
, O
he O
puts O
an O
additional O
price O
on O
his O
goods O
; O
and O
the O
consumers O
, O
who O
are O
chiefly O
landholders O

What O
was O
the O
temper O
of O
America B-Organization
towards O
Great-Britain B-Organization
before O
the O
year O
1763 O
? O

A O
. O

The O
best O
in O
the O
world O
. O

They O
submitted O
willingly O
to O
the O
government B-Organization
of I-Organization
the I-Organization
Crown I-Organization
, O
and O
paid O
, O
in O
all O
their O
courts B-Organization
, O
obedience O
to O
acts O
of O
parliament B-Organization
. O

Numerous O
as O
the O
people O
are O
in O
the O
several O
old B-Location
provinces I-Location
, O
they O
cost O
you O
nothing O
in O
forts O
, O
citadels O
, O
garrisons O
or O
armies O
, O
to O
keep O
them O
in O
subjection O
. O

They O
were O
governed O
by O
this O
country B-Organization
at O
the O
expence O
only O
of O
a O
little O
pen O
, O
ink O
and O
paper O
. O

They O
were O
led O
by O
a O
thread O
. O

They O
had O
not O
only O
a O
respect O
, O
but O
an O
affection O
, O
for O
Great-Britain B-Organization
, O
for O
its O
laws O
, O
its O
customs O
and O
manners O
, O
and O
even O
a O
fondness O
for O
its O
fashions O
, O
that O
greatly O
increased O
the O
commerce O
. O

Natives O
of O
Britain B-Location
were O
always O
treated O
with O
particular O
regard O
; O
to O
be O
an O
Old O
England O

man O
, O
was O
, O
of O
itself O
, O
a O
character O
of O
some O
respect O

and O
gave O
a O
kind O
of O
rank O
among O

Q O

And O
what O
is O
their O
temper O
now O
? O

A O

O O

very O
much O
altered O

Q O

Did O
you O
ever O
hear O
the O
authority O
of O
parliament B-Organization
to O
make O
laws O
for O
America B-Organization
questioned O
till O
lately O
? O

A O
. O

The O
authority O
of O
parliament B-Organization
was O
allowed O
to O
be O
valid O
in O
all O
laws O
, O
except O
such O
as O
should O
lay O
internal O
taxes O
. O

It O
was O
never O
disputed O
in O
laying O
duties O
to O
regulate O

. O

Q O
. O

In O
what O
proportion O
hath O
population O
increased O
in O
America B-Location
? O

A O
. O

I O
think O
the O
inhabitants O
of O
all O
the O
provinces B-Location
together O
, O
taken O
at O
a O
medium O
, O
double O
in O
about O
25 O
years O
. O

But O
their O
demand O
for O
British O
manufactures O
increases O
much O
faster O
, O
as O
the O
consumption O
is O
not O
merely O
in O
proportion O
to O
their O
numbers O
, O
but O
grows O
with O
the O
growing O
abilities O
of O
the O
same O
numbers O
to O
pay O
for O
them O
. O

In O
1723 O
, O
the O
whole O
importation O
from O
Britain B-Location
to O
Pennsylvania B-Location
, O
was O
but O
about O
15,000 O
Pounds O
Sterling O
; O
it O
is O
now O
near O
Half O
a O
Million O

Q O
. O

In O
what O
light O
did O
the O
people O
of O
America B-Location
use O
to O
consider O
the O
parliament B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great-Britain I-Organization
? O

A O
. O

They O
considered O
the O
parliament B-Organization
as O
the O
great O
bulwark O
and O
security O
of O
their O
liberties O
and O
privileges O
, O
and O
always O
spoke O
of O
it O
with O
the O
utmost O
respect O
and O
veneration O
. O

Arbitrary O
ministers O
, O
they O
thought O
, O
might O
possibly O
, O
at O
times O
, O
attempt O
to O
oppress O
them O
; O
but O
they O
relied O
on O
it O
, O
that O
the O
parliament B-Organization
, O
on O
application O
, O
would O
always O
give O
redress O
. O

They O
remembered O
, O
with O
gratitude O
, O
a O
strong O
instance O
of O
this O
, O
when O
a O
bill O
was O
brought O
into O
parliament B-Organization
, O
with O
a O
clause O
to O
make O
royal O
instructions O
laws O
in O
the O
Colonies B-Location
, O
which O
the O
house B-Organization
of I-Organization
commons I-Organization
would O
not O
pass O
, O
and O
it O
was O
thrown O
out O
. O

Q O
. O

And O
have O
they O
not O
still O
the O
same O
respect O
for O
parliament B-Organization
? O

A O
. O

No O
; O
it O
is O
greatly O
lessened O
. O

Q O
. O

To O
what O
causes O
is O
that O
owing O
? O

A O
. O

To O
a O
concurrence O
of O
causes O
; O
the O
restraints O
lately O
laid O
on O
their O
trade O
, O
by O
which O
the O
bringing O
of O
foreign O
gold O
and O
silver O
into O
the O
Colonies B-Location
was O
prevented O
; O
the O
prohibition O
of O
making O
paper O
money O
among O
themselves O
; O
and O
then O
demanding O
a O
new O
and O
heavy O
tax O
by O
stamps O
; O
taking O
away O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
trials O
by O
juries O
, O
and O
refusing O
to O
receive O
and O
hear O
their O
humble O
petitions O
. O

Q O
. O

Don O
’ O
t O
you O
think O
they O
would O
submit O
to O
the O
stamp-act O
, O
if O
it O
was O
modified O
, O
the O
obnoxious O
parts O
taken O
out O
, O
and O
the O
duty O
reduced O
to O
some O
particulars O
, O
of O
small O
moment O
? O

A O

No O
; O
they O
will O
never O
submit O
to O
it O
. O

Q O
. O

What O
do O
you O
think O
is O
the O
reason O
that O
the O
people O
of O
America B-Location
increase O
faster O
than O
in O
England B-Location
? O

A O
. O

Because O
they O
marry O
younger O
, O
and O
more O
generally O
. O

Q O
. O

Why O
so O
? O

A O
. O

Because O
any O
young O
couple O
that O
are O
industrious O
, O
may O
easily O
obtain O
land O
of O
their O
own O
, O
on O
which O
they O
can O
raise O
a O
family O
. O

Q O
. O

Are O
not O
the O
lower O
rank O
of O
people O
more O
at O
their O
ease O
in O
America B-Location
than O
in O
England B-Location
? O

A O
. O

They O
may O
be O
so O
, O
if O
they O
are O
sober O
and O
diligent O
, O
as O
they O
are O
better O
paid O
for O
their O
labour O

Q O

What O
is O
your O
opinion O
of O
a O
future O
tax O
, O
imposed O
on O
the O
same O
principle O
with O
that O
of O
the O
stamp O
act O
; O
how O
would O
the O
Americans O
receive O
it O
? O

A O

Just O
as O
they O
do O
this O
. O

They O
would O
not O
pay O
it O
. O

Q O

Have O
you O
not O
heard O
of O
the O
resolutions O
of O
this O
house B-Organization
, O
and O
of O
the O
house B-Organization
of I-Organization
lords I-Organization
, O
asserting O
the O
right O
of O

relating O
to O
America B-Organization
, O
including O
a O
power O
to O
tax O
the O
people O
there O

A O

Yes O
, O
I O
have O
heard O
of O
such O
resolutions O

What O
will O
be O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
Americans O
on O
those O
resolutions O
? O

A O
. O

They O
will O
think O
them O
unconstitutional O
, O
and O
unjust O
. O

Q O
. O

Was O
it O
an O
opinion O
in O
America B-Location
before O
1763 O
, O
that O
the O
parliament B-Organization
had O
no O
right O
to O
lay O
taxes O
and O
duties O
there O
? O

A O
. O

I O
never O
heard O
any O
objection O
to O
the O
right O
of O
laying O
duties O
to O
regulate O
commerce O
; O
but O
a O
right O
to O
lay O
internal O
taxes O
was O
never O
supposed O
to O
be O
in O
parliament B-Organization
, O
as O
we O
are O
not O
represented O
there O
. O

Q O
. O

On O
what O
do O
you O
found O
your O
opinion O
, O
that O
the O
people O
in O
America B-Location
made O
any O
such O
distinction O
? O

A O

I O
know O
that O
whenever O
the O
subject O
has O
occurred O
in O
conversation O
where O
I O
have O
been O
present O
, O
it O
has O
appeared O
to O
be O
the O
opinion O
of O
every O
one O
, O
that O
we O
could O
not O
be O
taxed O
in O
a O
parliament B-Organization
where O
we O
were O
not O
represented O
. O

But O
the O
payment O
of O
duties O
laid O
by O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
, O
as O
regulations O
of O
commerce O
, O
was O
never O
disputed O

Q O

But O
can O
you O
name O
any O
act O
of O
assembly B-Organization
, O
or O
public O
act O
of O
any O
of O
your O
governments O

that O
made O
such O
distinction O

A O

I O
do O
not O
know O
that O
there O
was O
any O
; O
I O
think O
there O
was O
never O
an O
occasion O
to O
make O
any O
such O
act O
, O
till O
now O
that O
you O
have O
attempted O
to O
tax O
us O
; O
that O
has O
occasioned O
resolutions O
of O
assembly B-Organization
, O
declaring O
the O
distinction O
, O
in O
which O
I O
think O
every O
assembly O
on O
the O
continent B-Location
, O
and O
every O
member O
in O
every O
assembly B-Organization

have O
been O
unanimous O

What O
then O
could O
occasion O
conversations O
on O
that O
subject O
before O
that O
time O
? O

A O
. O

There O
was O
in O
1754 O
a O
proposition O
made O
( O
I O
think O
it O
came O
from O
hence O
) O
that O
in O
case O
of O
a O
war O
, O
which O
was O
then O
apprehended O
, O
the O
governors B-Organization
of I-Organization
the I-Organization

meet O

the O
levying O
of O

building O
of O
forts O
, O
and O
taking O
every O
other O
necessary O
measure O
for O
the O
general O
defence O
; O
and O
should O
draw O
on O
the O
treasury O
here O
for O
the O
sums O
expended O
, O
which O
were O
afterwards O
to O
be O
raised O
in O
the O
Colonies B-Location
by O
a O
general O
tax O
, O
to O
be O
laid O
on O
them O
by O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
. O

This O
occasioned O
a O
good O
deal O
of O
conversation O
on O
the O
subject O
, O
and O
the O
general O
opinion O
was O
, O
that O
the O
parliament B-Organization
neither O
would O
nor O
could O
lay O
any O
tax O
on O
us O
, O
till O
we O
were O
duly O
represented O
in O
parliament B-Organization

because O
it O
was O
not O

the O
nature O
of O
an O
English O
constitution O

Q O

A O

They O
could O
not O
suppose O
such O
a O
case O
, O
as O
that O
the O
assembly O
would O
not O
raise O
the O
necessary O
supplies O
to O
support O
its O
own O
government O
. O

An O
assembly O
that O
would O
refuse O
it O
must O
want O
common O
sense O
, O
which O
cannot O
be O
supposed O
. O

I O
think O
there O
was O
never O
any O
such O
case O
at O
New-York B-Location
, O
and O
that O
it O
must O
be O
a O
misrepresentation O
, O
or O
the O
fact O
must O
be O
misunderstood O
. O

I O
know O
there O
have O
been O
some O
attempts O
, O
by O
ministerial O
instructions O
from O
hence O
, O
to O
oblige O
the O
assemblies O
to O
settle O
permanent O
salaries O
on O
governors O
, O
which O
they O
wisely O
refused O
to O
do O
; O
but O
I O
believe O
no O
assembly B-Organization
of I-Organization
New-York I-Organization
, O
or O
any O
other O
Colony O
, O
ever O
refused O
duly O
to O
support O
government O
by O
proper O
allowances O
, O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
to O
public O
officers O
. O

Q O
. O

But O
in O
case O
a O
governor O
, O
acting O
by O
instruction O
, O
should O
call O
on O
an O
assembly O
to O
raise O
the O
necessary O
supplies O
, O
and O
the O
assembly O
should O
refuse O
to O
do O
it O
, O
do O
you O
not O
think O
it O
would O
then O
be O
for O
the O
good O
of O
the O
people O
of O
the O
colony O
, O
as O
well O
as O
necessary O
to O
government O
, O
that O
the O
parliament B-Organization
should O
tax O
them O
? O

A O
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
it O
would O
be O
necessary O
. O

If O
an O
assembly O
could O
possibly O
be O
so O
absurd O
as O
to O
refuse O
raising O
the O
supplies O
requisite O
for O
the O
maintenance O
of O
government O
among O
them O
, O
they O
could O
not O
long O
remain O
in O
such O
a O
situation O
; O
the O
disorders O
and O
confusion O
occasioned O
by O
it O
must O
soon O
bring O
them O
to O
reason O
. O

Q O
. O

If O
it O
should O
not O
, O
ought O
not O
the O
right O
to O
be O
in O
Great-Britain B-Location
of O
applying O
a O
remedy O
? O

A O
. O

A O
right O
only O
to O
be O
used O
in O
such O
a O
case O
, O
I O
should O
have O
no O
objection O
to O
, O
supposing O
it O
to O
be O
used O
merely O
for O
the O
good O
of O
the O
people O
of O
the O
Colony O
. O

Q O
. O

But O
who O
is O
to O
judge O
of O
that O
, O
Britain B-Organization
or O
the O
Colony O
? O

A O
. O

Those O
that O
feel O
can O
best O
judge O
. O

Q O
. O

You O
say O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
have O
always O
submitted O
to O
external O
taxes O
, O
and O
object O
to O
the O
right O
of O
parliament B-Organization
only O
in O
laying O
internal O
taxes O
; O
now O
can O
you O
shew O
that O
there O
is O
any O
kind O
of O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
taxes O
to O
the O
Colony O
on O
which O
they O
may O
be O
laid O
? O

A O
. O

I O
think O
the O
difference O
is O
very O
great O
. O

An O
external O
tax O
is O
a O
duty O
laid O
on O
commodities O
imported O
; O
that O
duty O
is O
added O
to O
the O
first O
cost O
, O
and O
other O
charges O
on O
the O
commodity O
, O
and O
when O
it O
is O
offered O
to O
sale O
, O
makes O
a O
part O
of O
the O
price O
. O

If O
the O
people O
do O
not O
like O
it O
at O
that O
price O
, O
they O
refuse O
it O
; O
they O
are O
not O
obliged O
to O
pay O
it O
. O

But O
an O
internal O
tax O
is O
forced O
from O
the O
people O
without O
their O
consent O
, O
if O
not O
laid O
by O
their O
own O
representatives O
. O

The O
stamp-act O
says O
, O
we O
shall O
have O
no O
commerce O
, O
make O
no O
exchange O
of O
property O
with O
each O
other O
, O
neither O
purchase O
nor O
grant O
, O
nor O
recover O
debts O
; O
we O
shall O
neither O
marry O
, O
nor O
make O
our O
wills O
, O
unless O
we O
pay O
such O
and O
such O
sums O
, O
and O
thus O
it O
is O
intended O
to O
extort O
our O
money O
from O
us O
, O
or O
ruin O
us O
by O
the O
consequences O
of O
refusing O
to O
pay O
it O
. O

Q O
. O

But O
supposing O
the O
external O
tax O
or O
duty O
to O
be O
laid O
on O
the O
necessaries O
of O
life O
imported O
into O
your O
Colony B-Location
, O
will O
not O
that O
be O
the O
same O
thing O
in O
its O
effects O
as O
an O
internal O
tax O
? O

A O
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
a O
single O
article O
imported O
into O
the O
Northern B-Location
Colonies I-Location
, O
but O
what O
they O
can O
either O
do O
without O
, O
or O
make O
themselves O
. O

Q O
. O

Don O
’ O
t O
you O
think O
cloth O
from O
England B-Location
absolutely O
necessary O
to O
them O
? O

A O
. O

No O
, O
by O
no O
means O
absolutely O
necessary O
; O
with O
industry O
and O
good O
management O
, O
that O
may O
very O
well O
supply O
themselves O
with O
all O
they O
want O
. O

Q O
. O

Will O
it O
not O
take O
a O
long O
time O
to O
establish O
that O
manufacture O
among O
them O
? O

and O
must O
they O
not O
in O
the O
mean O
while O
suffer O
greatly O
? O

A O
. O

I O
think O
not O
. O

They O
have O
made O
a O
surprising O
progress O
already O
. O

And O
I O
am O
of O
opinion O
, O
that O
before O
their O
old O
clothes O
are O
worn O
out O
, O
they O
will O
have O
new O
ones O
of O
their O
own O
making O
. O

Q O
. O

Can O
they O
possibly O
find O
wool O
enough O
in O
North-America B-Location
? O

A O
. O

They O
have O
taken O
steps O
to O
increase O
the O
wool O
. O

They O
entered O
into O
general O
combinations O
to O
eat O
no O
more O
lamb O
, O
and O
very O
few O
lambs O
were O
killed O
last O
year O
. O

This O
course O
persisted O
in O
, O
will O
soon O
make O
a O
prodigious O
difference O
in O
the O
quantity O
of O
wool O
. O

And O
the O
establishing O
of O
great O
manufactories O
, O
like O
those O
in O
the O
clothing O
towns O
here O
, O
is O
not O
necessary O
, O
as O
it O
is O
where O
the O
business O
is O
to O
be O
carried O
on O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O
trade O
. O

The O
people O
will O
all O
spin O
, O
and O
work O
for O
themselves O
, O
in O
their O
own O
houses O
. O

Q O
. O

Can O
there O
be O
wool O
and O
manufacture O
enough O
in O
one O
or O
two O
years O
? O

A O
. O

In O
three O
years O
, O
I O
think O
, O
there O
may O
. O

Q O
. O

Does O
not O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
winter O
, O
in O
the O
Northern B-Location
Colonies I-Location
, O
occasion O
the O
wool O
to O
be O
of O
bad O
quality O
? O

A O
. O

No O
; O
the O
wool O
is O
very O
fine O
and O
good O
. O

Q O
. O

In O
the O
more O
Southern B-Location
Colonies I-Location
, O
as O
in O
Virginia B-Location
; O
don O
’ O
t O
you O
know O
that O
the O
wool O
is O
coarse O
, O
and O
only O
a O
kind O
of O
hair O
? O

A O
. O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
know O
it O
. O

I O
never O
heard O
it O
. O

Yet O
I O
have O
been O
sometimes O
in O
Virginia B-Location
. O

I O
cannot O
say O
I O
ever O
took O
particular O
notice O
of O
the O
wool O
there O
, O
but O
I O
believe O
it O
is O
good O
, O
though O
I O
cannot O
speak O
positively O
of O
it O
; O
but O
Virginia B-Location
, O
and O
the O
Colonies B-Location
south I-Location
of I-Location
it I-Location
, O
have O
less O
occasion O
for O
wool O
; O
their O
winters O
are O
short O
, O
and O
not O
very O
severe O
, O
and O
they O
can O
very O
well O
clothe O
themselves O
with O
linen O
and O
cotton O
of O
their O
own O
raising O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
year O
. O

Q O
. O

Are O
not O
the O
people O
, O
in O
the O
more O
Northern B-Location
Colonies I-Location
, O
obliged O
to O
fodder O
their O
sheep O
all O
the O
winter O
? O

A O
. O

In O
some O
of O
the O
most O
Northern B-Location
Colonies I-Location
they O
may O
be O
obliged O
to O
do O
it O
some O
part O
of O
the O
winter O
. O

Q O
. O

Considering O
the O
resolutions O
of O
parliament B-Organization
, O
as O
to O
the O
right O
, O
do O
you O
think O
, O
if O
the O
stamp-act O
is O
repealed O
, O
that O
the O
North O
Americans O
will O
be O
satisfied O
? O

A O
. O

I O
believe O
they O
will O
. O

Q O
. O

Why O
do O
you O
think O
so O
? O

A O
. O

I O
think O
the O
resolutions O
of O
right O
will O
give O
them O
very O
little O
concern O
, O
if O
they O
are O
never O
attempted O
to O
be O
carried O
into O
practice O
. O

The O
Colonies B-Organization
will O
probably O
consider O
themselves O
in O
the O
same O
situation O
, O
in O
that O
respect O
, O
with O
Ireland B-Organization
; O
they O
know O
you O
claim O
the O
same O
right O
with O
regard O
to O
Ireland B-Organization
, O
but O
you O
never O
exercise O
it O
. O

And O
they O
may O
believe O
you O
never O
will O
exercise O
it O
in O
the O
Colonies B-Location
, O
any O
more O
than O
in O
Ireland B-Location
, O
unless O
on O
some O
very O
extraordinary O
occasion O
. O

Q O
. O

But O
who O
are O
to O
be O
the O
judges O
of O
that O
extraordinary O
occasion O
? O

Is O
it O
not O
the O
parliament B-Organization
? O

A O
. O

Though O
the O
parliament B-Organization
may O
judge O
of O
the O
occasion O
, O
the O
people O
will O
think O
it O
can O
never O
exercise O
such O
right O
, O
till O
representatives O
from O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
are O
admitted O
into O
parliament B-Organization

and O
that O
whenever O
the O
occasion O
arises O
, O
representatives O
will O
be O
ordered O

Q O
. O

Did O
you O
never O
hear O
that O
Maryland B-Organization
, O
during O
the O
last O
war O
, O
had O
refused O
to O
furnish O
a O
quota O
towards O
the O
common O
defence O
? O

A O
. O

Maryland B-Organization
has O
been O
much O
misrepresented O
in O
that O
matter O
. O

Maryland B-Organization
, O
to O
my O
knowledge O
, O
never O
refused O
to O
contribute O
, O
or O
grant O
aids O
to O
the O
Crown B-Organization
. O

The O
assemblies O
every O
year O
, O
during O
the O
war O
, O
voted O
considerable O
sums O
, O
and O
formed O
bills O
to O
raise O
them O
. O

The O
bills O
were O
, O
according O
to O
the O
constitution O
of O
that O
province B-Organization
, O
sent O
up O
to O
the O
council B-Organization
, O
or O
upper B-Organization
house I-Organization
, O
for O
concurrence O
, O
that O
they O
might O
be O
presented O
to O
the O
governor O
, O
in O
order O
to O
be O
enacted O
into O
laws O
. O

Unhappy O
disputes O
between O
the O
two B-Organization
houses I-Organization
arising O
, O
from O
the O
defects O
of O
that O
constitution O
principally O
, O
rendered O
all O
the O

one O
or O
two O
abortive O

The O
proprietary B-Organization

council I-Organization
rejected O
them O
. O

It O
is O
true O
Maryland B-Organization
did O
not O
contribute O
its O
proportion O
, O
but O
it O
was O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O

the O
fault O
of O
the O
government B-Organization

not O
of O
the O
people O

them O

and O
the O
last O
, O
which O
are O
much O
the O
greatest O
part O
, O
they O
will O
strike O
off O
immediately O
. O

They O
are O
mere O
articles O
of O
fashion O
, O
purchased O
and O
consumed O
, O
because O
the O
fashion O
in O
a O
respected O
country O
, O
but O
will O
now O
be O
detested O
and O
rejected O
. O

The O
people O
have O
already O
struck O
off O
, O
by O
general O
agreement O
, O
the O
use O
of O
all O
goods O
fashionable O
in O
mournings O

many O

Q O
. O

Is O
it O
their O
interest O
to O
make O
cloth O
at O
home O
? O

A O
. O

I O
think O
they O
may O
at O
present O
get O
it O
cheaper O
from O
Britain B-Location
, O
I O
mean O
of O
the O
same O
fineness O
and O
neatness O
of O
workmanship O
; O
but O
when O
one O
considers O
other O
circumstances O
, O
the O
restraints O
on O
their O
trade O
, O
and O
the O
difficulty O
of O
making O
remittances O
, O
it O
is O
their O
interest O
to O
make O
every O
thing O
. O

Q O
. O

Suppose O
an O
act O
of O
internal O
regulation O
, O
connected O
with O
a O
tax O
, O
how O
would O
they O
receive O
it O
? O

A O
. O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
objected O
to O
. O

Q O
. O

Then O
no O
regulation O
with O
a O
tax O
would O
be O
submitted O
to O
? O

A O
. O

Their O
opinion O
is O
, O
that O
when O
aids O
to O
the O
Crown B-Organization
are O
wanted O
, O
they O
are O
to O
be O
asked O
of O
the O
several O
assemblies O
, O
according O
to O
the O
old O
established O
usage O
, O
who O
will O
, O
as O
they O
always O
have O
done O
, O
grant O
them O
freely O
. O

And O
that O
their O
money O
ought O
not O
to O
be O
given O
away O
without O
their O
consent O
, O
by O
persons O
at O
a O
distance O
, O
unacquainted O
with O
their O
circumstances O
and O
abilities O
. O

The O
granting O
aids O
to O
the O
Crown B-Organization
, O
is O
the O
only O
means O
they O
have O
of O
recommending O
themselves O
to O
their O
sovereign O
, O
and O
they O
think O
it O
extremely O
hard O
and O
unjust O
, O
that O
a O
body O
of O
men O
, O
in O
which O
they O
have O
no O
representatives O
, O
should O
make O
a O
merit O
to O
itself O
of O
giving O
and O
granting O
what O
is O
not O
its O
own O
, O
but O
theirs O
, O
and O
deprive O
them O
of O
a O
right O
they O
esteem O
of O
the O
utmost O
value O
and O
importance O
, O
as O
it O
is O
the O
security O
of O
all O
their O
other O
rights O
. O

Q O
. O

But O
is O
not O
the O
post-office B-Organization
, O
which O
they O
have O
long O
received O
, O
a O
tax O
as O
well O
as O
a O
regulation O
? O

A O
. O

No O
; O
the O
money O
paid O
for O
the O
postage O
of O
a O
letter O
is O
not O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
a O
tax O
; O
it O
is O
merely O
a O
quantum O
meruit O
for O
a O
service O
done O
; O
no O
person O
is O
compellable O
to O
pay O
the O
money O
, O
if O
he O
does O
not O
chuse O
to O
receive O
the O
service O
. O

A O
man O
may O
still O
, O
as O
before O
the O
act O

send O
his O
letter O
by O
a O
servant O

a O
special O

, O
if O
he O
thinks O
it O
cheaper O

Q O
. O

But O
do O
they O
not O
consider O
the O
regulations O
of O
the O
post-office B-Organization
, O
by O
the O
act O
of O
last O
year O
, O
as O
a O
tax O
? O

A O
. O

By O
the O
regulations O
of O
last O
year O
the O
rate O
of O
postage O
was O
generally O
abated O
near O
thirty O
per O
cent O
. O
through O
all O
America B-Location
; O
they O
certainly O
cannot O
consider O
such O
abatement O
as O
a O
tax O
. O

Q O
. O

If O
an O
excise O
was O
laid O
by O
parliament B-Organization
, O
which O
they O
might O
likewise O
avoid O
paying O
, O
by O
not O
consuming O
the O
articles O
excised O
, O
would O
they O
then O
not O
object O
to O
it O
? O

A O
. O

They O
would O
certainly O
object O
to O
it O
, O
as O
an O
excise O
is O
unconnected O
with O
any O
service O
done O
, O
and O
is O
merely O
an O
aid O
which O
they O
think O
ought O
to O
be O
asked O
of O
them O
, O
and O
granted O
by O
them O
, O
if O
they O
are O
to O
pay O
it O
, O
and O
can O
be O
granted O
for O
them O
by O
no O
others O
whatsoever O
, O
whom O
they O
have O
not O
impowered O
for O
that O
purpose O
. O

Q O
. O

You O
say O
they O
do O
not O
object O
to O
the O
right O
of O
parliament B-Organization
in O
laying O
duties O
on O
goods O
to O
be O
paid O
on O
their O
importation O
; O
now O
, O
is O
there O
any O
kind O
of O
difference O
between O
a O
duty O
on O
the O
importation O
of O
goods O
, O
and O
an O
excise O
on O
their O
consumption O
? O

A O
. O

Yes O
; O
a O
very O
material O
one O
; O
an O
excise O
, O
for O
the O
reasons O
I O
have O
just O
mentioned O
, O
they O
think O
you O
can O
have O
no O
right O
to O
lay O
within O
their O
country O
. O

But O
the O
sea O
is O
yours O
; O
you O
maintain O
, O
by O
your O
fleets O
, O
the O
safety O
of O
navigation O
in O
it O
; O
and O
keep O
it O
clear O
of O
pirates O
; O
you O
may O
have O
therefore O
a O
natural O
and O
equitable O
right O
to O
some O
toll O
or O
duty O
on O
merchandizes O
carried O
through O
that O

the O

you O
are O
at O

to O
maintain O
the O
safety O
of O
that O

Q O
. O

Does O
this O
reasoning O
hold O
in O
the O
case O
of O
a O
duty O
laid O
on O
the O
produce O
of O
their O
lands O
exported O
? O

and O
would O
they O
not O
then O
object O
to O
such O
a O
duty O
? O

A O
. O

If O
it O
tended O
to O
make O
the O
produce O
so O
much O
dearer O
abroad O
as O
to O
lessen O
the O
demand O
for O
it O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
they O
would O
object O
to O
such O
a O
duty O
; O
not O
to O
your O
right O
of O
laying O
it O
, O
but O
they O
would O
complain O
of O
it O
as O
a O
burthen O
, O
and O
petition O
you O
to O
lighten O
it O
. O

Q O
. O

Is O
not O
the O
duty O
paid O
on O
the O
tobacco O
exported O
a O
duty O
of O
that O
kind O
? O

A O
. O

That O
, O
I O
think O
, O
is O
only O
on O
tobacco O
carried O
coastwise O
from O
one O

appropriated O

I O
am O
not O

the O

Fifteen O

about O
20,000 O

Supposing O
the O

do O
you O

A O

Yes O
, O
I O
think O
so O

People O
will O
pay O

a O
very O
small O

compared O
with O
the O

What O
are O
the O

Would O
they O
suffer O
the O

of O
their O

rot O

A O
. O

No O
; O
but O
they O
would O
not O
raise O
so O
much O

They O
would O
manufacture O
more O

Q O

Would O
they O
live O
without O
the O

and O
suffer O
all O
the O
inconveniencies O
of O
such O
a O
situation O
for O
any O
considerable O
time O
, O
rather O
than O
take O
the O
stamps O
, O
supposing O
the O
stamps O
were O
protected O
by O
a O
sufficient O
force O
, O
where O
every O
one O
might O
have O
them O
? O

A O
. O

I O
think O
the O
supposition O
impracticable O
, O
that O
the O
stamps O
should O
be O
so O
protected O
as O
that O
every O
one O
might O
have O
them O
. O

The O
act O
requires O
subdistributors O
to O
be O
appointed O
in O
every O
county O
town O
, O
district O
and O
village O
, O
and O
they O
would O
be O
necessary O
. O

But O
the O
principal O
distributors O
, O
who O
were O
to O
have O
had O
a O
considerable O
profit O
on O
the O
whole O
, O
have O
not O
thought O
it O
worth O
while O
to O
continue O
in O
the O
office O
, O
and O
I O
think O
it O
impossible O
to O
find O
sub-distributors O
fit O
to O
be O
trusted O
, O
who O
, O
for O
the O
trifling O
profit O
that O
must O
come O
to O
their O
share O
, O
would O
incur O
the O
odium O
, O
and O
run O
the O
hazard O
that O
would O
attend O
it O
; O
and O
if O
they O
could O
be O
found O
, O
I O
think O
it O
impracticable O
to O
protect O
the O
stamps O
in O
so O
many O
distant O
and O
remote O
places O
. O

Q O
. O

But O
in O
places O
where O
they O
could O
be O
protected O
, O
would O
not O
the O
people O
use O
them O
rather O
than O
remain O
in O
such O
a O
situation O
, O
unable O
to O
obtain O
any O
right O
, O
or O
recover O
, O
by O

any O

A O
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
say O
what O
they O
would O

I O
can O
only O
judge O
what O

how O
they O
will O
act O

by O
what O
I O

I O
have O
a O
great O

I O
had O
rather O
they O

submit O
to O
the O
stamp-act O

They O
will O
be O
debts O

It O
is O
my O
opinion O
the O

will O
either O
continue O
in O
that O

find O
some O
way O

Q O

A O
. O

The O

part O
of O
the O

must O
arise O

for O
the O

the O
lower O
sort O
of O
people O

who O
were O
too O
poor O
easily O
to O
pay O
their O

It O
is O
therefore O
a O
heavy O
tax O
on O
the O
poor O

and O
a O
tax O
upon O
them O
for O
being O
poor O

Q O

But O
will O
not O
this O
increase O
of O

be O
a O
means O
of O
lessening O
the O
number O

A O
. O

I O
think O
not O
; O
for O
as O
the O
costs O
all O
fall O
upon O
the O
debtor O
, O
and O
are O
to O
be O
paid O
by O
him O

they O
would O
be O
no O
discouragement O

the O
creditor O

his O
action O

Would O
it O
not O
have O
the O
effect O

How O

A O

I O
cannot O
speak O
to O
the O
number O

I O
know O
that O
in O
1752 O
, O
10,000 O
hogsheads O
of O
flax-seed O
, O
each O
containing O
7 O
bushels O

were O
exported O
from O

I O
suppose O
the O
quantity O
is O
greatly O
increased O
since O
that O
time O

and O
it O
is O
understood O
that O
the O

, O
would O
not O
the O
Americans O
think O
they O
could O
oblige O
the O
parliament B-Organization
to O
repeal O
every O
external O
tax O
law O
now O
in O
force O
? O

A O
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
answer O
questions O
of O
what O
people O
at O
such O
a O
distance O
will O
think O
. O

Q O
. O

But O
what O
do O
you O
imagine O
they O
will O
think O
were O
the O
motives O
of O
repealing O
the O
act O
? O

A O
. O

I O
suppose O
they O
will O
think O
that O
it O
was O
repealed O
from O
a O
conviction O
of O
its O
inexpediency O
; O
and O
they O
will O
rely O
upon O
it O
, O
that O
while O
the O
same O
inexpediency O
subsists O
, O
you O
will O
never O
attempt O
to O
make O
such O
another O
. O

Q O
. O

What O
do O
you O
mean O
by O
its O
inexpediency O
? O

A O
. O

I O
mean O
its O
inexpediency O
on O
several O
accounts O
; O
the O
poverty O
and O
inability O
of O
those O
who O
were O
to O
pay O
the O
tax O
; O
the O
general O
discontent O
it O
has O
occasioned O
; O
and O
the O
impracticability O
of O
enforcing O
it O
. O

Q O
. O

If O
the O
act O
should O
be O
repealed O
, O
and O
the O
legislature O
should O
shew O
its O
resentment O
to O
the O
opposers O
of O
the O
stamp-act O
, O
would O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
acquiesce O
in O
the O
authority O
of O
the O
legislature B-Organization
? O

What O
is O
your O
opinion O
they O
would O
do O
? O

A O
. O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
doubt O
at O
all O
, O
that O
if O
the O
legislature B-Organization
repeal O
the O
stamp-act O
, O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
will O
acquiesce O
in O
the O
authority O
. O

Q O
. O

But O
if O
the O
legislature B-Organization
should O
think O
fit O
to O
ascertain O
its O
right O
to O
lay O
taxes O
, O
by O
any O
act O
laying O
a O
small O
tax O
, O
contrary O
to O
their O
opinion O
, O
would O
they O
submit O
to O
pay O
the O
tax O
? O

A O
. O

The O
proceedings O
of O
the O
people O
in O
America B-Location
have O
been O
considered O
too O
much O
together O
. O

The O
proceedings O
of O
the O
assemblies B-Organization
have O
been O
very O
different O
from O
those O
of O
the O
mobs O
, O
and O
should O
be O
distinguished O
, O
as O
having O
no O
connection O
with O
each O
other O
. O

— O
The O
assemblies B-Organization
have O
only O
peaceably O
resolved O
what O
they O
take O
to O
be O
their O
rights O
; O
they O
have O
taken O
no O
measures O
for O
opposition O
by O
force O
; O
they O
have O
not O
built O
a O
fort O
, O
raised O
a O
man O
, O
or O
provided O
a O
grain O
of O
ammunition O
, O
in O
order O
to O
such O
opposition O
. O

— O
The O
ringleaders O
of O
riots O
they O
think O
ought O
to O
be O
punished O
; O
they O
would O
punish O
them O
themselves O
, O
if O
they O
could O
. O

Every O
sober O
sensible O
man O
would O
wish O
to O
see O
rioters O
punished O
, O
as O
otherwise O
peaceable O
people O
have O
no O
security O
of O
person O
or O
estate O
. O

But O
as O
to O
any O
internal O
tax O
, O
how O
small O
soever O
, O
laid O
by O
the O
legislature B-Organization
here O
on O
the O
people O
there O
, O
while O
they O
have O
no O
representatives O
in O
this O
legislature B-Organization
, O
I O
think O
it O
will O
never O
be O
submitted O
to O
. O

— O
They O
will O
oppose O
it O
to O
the O
last O
. O

— O
They O
do O
not O
consider O
it O
as O
at O
all O
necessary O
for O
you O
to O
raise O
money O
on O
them O
by O
your O
taxes O
, O
because O
they O
are O
, O
and O
always O
have O
been O
, O
ready O
to O
raise O
money O
by O
taxes O
among O
themselves O
, O
and O
to O
grant O
large O
sums O
, O
equal O
to O
their O
abilities O
, O
upon O
requisition O
from O
the O
Crown B-Organization

— O
They O
have O
not O
only O
granted O
equal O
to O
their O
abilities O
, O
but O
, O
during O
all O
the O
last O
war O
, O
they O
granted O
far O
beyond O
their O
abilities O
, O
and O
beyond O
their O
proportion O
with O
this O
country B-Organization
, O
you O
yourselves O
being O
judges O
, O
to O
the O
amount O
of O
many O
hundred O
thousand O
pounds O
, O
and O
this O
they O
did O
freely O
and O
readily O
, O
only O
on O
a O
sort O
of O
promise O
from O
the O
secretary B-Person
of I-Person
state I-Person
, O
that O
it O
should O
be O
recommended O
to O

to O
make O
them O
compensation O
. O

It O
was O
accordingly O
recommended O
to O
parliament B-Organization
, O
in O
the O
most O
honourable O
manner O
, O
for O
them O
. O

America B-Organization
has O
been O
greatly O
misrepresented O
and O
abused O
here O
, O
in O
papers O
, O
and O
pamphlets O
, O
and O
speeches O
, O
as O
ungrateful O
, O
and O
unreasonable O
, O
and O
unjust O
, O
in O
having O
put O
this O
nation B-Organization
to O
immense O
expence O
for O
their O
defence O
, O
and O
refusing O
to O
bear O
any O
part O
of O
that O
expence O
. O

The O
Colonies B-Organization
raised O
, O
paid O
and O
clothed O
, O
near O
25000 O
men O
during O
the O
last O
war O
, O
a O
number O
equal O
to O
those O
sent O
from O
Britain B-Location
, O
and O
far O
beyond O
their O
proportion O
; O
they O
went O
deeply O
into O
debt O
in O
doing O
this O
, O
and O
all O
their O
taxes O
and O
estates O
are O
mortgaged O
, O
for O
many O
years O
to O
come O
, O
for O
discharging O
that O
debt O
. O

Government O
here O
was O
at O
that O
time O
very O
sensible O
of O
this O
. O

The O
Colonies B-Organization
were O
recommended O
to O
parliament B-Organization
. O

Every O
year O
the O
King B-Person
sent O
down O
to O
the O
house O
a O
written O
message O
to O
this O
purpose O
, O
That O
his O
Majesty B-Person
, O
being O
highly O
sensible O
of O
the O
zeal O
and O
vigour O
with O
which O
his O
faithful O
subjects O
in O
North-America B-Location
had O
exerted O
themselves O
, O
in O
defence O
of O
his O
Majesty B-Organization
’ O
s O
just O
rights O
and O
possessions O
, O
recommended O
it O
to O
the O
house O
to O
take O
the O
same O
into O
consideration O
, O
and O
enable O
him O
to O
give O
them O
a O
proper O
compensation O
. O

You O
will O
find O
those O
messages O
on O
your O
own O
journals O
every O
year O
of O
the O
war O
to O
the O
very O
last O
, O
and O
you O
did O
accordingly O
give O
200,000 O
Pounds O
annually O
to O
the O
Crown B-Organization
, O
to O
be O
distributed O
in O
such O
compensation O
to O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
. O

This O
is O
the O
strongest O
of O
all O
proofs O
that O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
, O
far O
from O
being O
unwilling O
to O
bear O
a O
share O
of O
the O
burthen O
, O
did O
exceed O
their O
proportion O
; O
for O
if O
they O
had O
done O
less O
, O
or O
had O
only O
equalled O
their O
proportion O
, O
there O
would O
have O
been O
no O
room O
or O
reason O
for O
compensation O
. O

— O
Indeed O
the O
sums O
reimbursed O
them O
, O
were O
by O
no O
means O
adequate O
to O
the O
expence O
they O
incurred O
beyond O
their O
proportion O
; O
but O
they O
never O
murmured O
at O
that O
; O
they O
esteemed O
their O
Sovereign B-Person
’ O
s O
approbation O
of O
their O
zeal O
and O
fidelity O
, O
and O
the O
approbation O
of O
this O
house B-Organization
, O
far O
beyond O
any O
other O
kind O
of O
compensation O
; O
therefore O
there O
was O
no O
occasion O
for O
this O
act O
, O
to O
force O
money O
from O
a O
willing O
people O
; O
they O
had O
not O
refused O
giving O
money O
for O
the O
purposes O
of O
the O
act O
; O
no O
requisition O
had O
been O
made O
; O
they O
were O
always O
willing O
and O
ready O
to O
do O
what O
could O
reasonably O
be O
expected O
from O
them O
, O
and O
in O
this O
light O
they O
wish O
to O
be O
considered O
. O

Q O
. O

But O
suppose O
Great-Britain B-Organization
should O
be O
engaged O
in O
a O
war O
in O
Europe B-Location
, O
would O
North-America B-Organization
contribute O
to O
the O
support O
of O
it O
? O

A O
. O

I O
do O
think O
they O
would O
, O
as O
far O
as O
their O
circumstances O
would O
permit O
. O

They O
consider O
themselves O
as O
a O
part O
of O
the O
British B-Organization
empire I-Organization
, O
and O
as O
having O
one O
common O
interest O
with O
it O
; O
they O
may O
be O
looked O
on O
here O
as O
foreigners O
, O
but O
they O
do O
not O
consider O
themselves O
as O
such O
. O

They O
are O
zealous O
for O
the O
honour O
and O
prosperity O
of O
this O
nation B-Organization
, O
and O
, O
while O
they O
are O
well O
used O
, O
will O
always O
be O
ready O
to O
support O
it O
, O
as O
far O
as O
their O
little O
power O
goes O
. O

In O
1739 O
they O
were O
called O
upon O
to O
assist O
in O
the O
expedition O
against O
Carthagena B-Location
, O
and O
they O
sent O
3000 O
men O
to O
join O
your O
army O
. O

It O
is O
true O
Carthagena B-Location
is O
in O
America B-Location
, O
but O
as O
remote O
from O
the O
Northern B-Location
Colonies I-Location
, O
as O
if O
it O
had O
been O
in O
Europe B-Location
. O

They O
make O
no O
distinction O
of O
wars O
, O
as O
to O
their O
duty O
of O
assisting O
in O
them O
. O

I O
know O
the O
last O
war O
is O
commonly O
spoke O
of O
here O
as O
entered O
into O
for O
the O
defence O
, O
or O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
the O
people O
of O
America B-Location
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
quite O
misunderstood O
. O

It O
began O
about O
the O
limits O
between O
Canada B-Location
and O
Nova-Scotia B-Location
, O
about O
territories O
to O
which O
the O
Crown B-Organization
indeed O
laid O
claim O
, O
but O
were O
not O
claimed O
by O
any O
British O
Colony O
; O
none O
of O
the O
lands O
had O
been O
granted O
to O
any O
Colonist O
; O
we O
had O
therefore O
no O
particular O
concern O
or O
interest O
in O
that O
dispute O
. O

As O
to O
the O
Ohio B-Location
, O
the O
contest O
there O
began O
about O
your O
right O
of O
trading O
in O
the O
Indian B-Location
country I-Location
, O
a O
right O
you O
had O
by O
the O
treaty O
of O
Utrecht B-Location
, O
which O
the O
French O
infringed O
; O
they O
seized O
the O
traders O
and O
their O
goods O
, O
which O
were O
your O
manufactures O
; O
they O
took O
a O
fort O
which O
a O
company O
of O
your O
merchants O
, O
and O
their O
factors O
and O
correspondents O
, O
had O
erected O
there O
, O
to O
secure O
that O
trade O
. O

Braddock B-Person
was O
sent O
with O
an O
army O
to O
re-take O
that O
fort O
( O
which O
was O
looked O
on O
here O
as O
another O
incroachment O
on O
the O
King B-Location
’ I-Location
s I-Location
territory I-Location
) O
and O
to O
protect O
your O
trade O
. O

It O
was O
not O
till O
after O
his O
defeat O
that O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
were O
attacked O
. O

They O
were O
before O
in O
perfect O
peace O
with O
both O
French O
and O
Indians O
; O
the O
troops O
were O
not O
therefore O
sent O
for O
their O
defence O
. O

The O
trade O
with O
the O
Indians O
, O
though O
carried O
on O
in O
America B-Location
, O
is O
not O
an O
American O
interest O
. O

The O
people O
of O
America B-Location
are O
chiefly O
farmers O
and O
planters O
; O
scarce O
any O
thing O
that O
they O
raise O
or O
produce O
is O
an O
article O
of O
commerce O
with O
the O
Indians O
. O

The O
Indian O
trade O
is O
a O
British O
interest O
; O
it O
is O
carried O
on O
with O
British O
manufactures O
, O
for O
the O
profit O
of O
British O
merchants O
and O
manufacturers O
; O
therefore O
the O
war O
, O
as O
it O
commenced O
for O
the O
defence O
of O
territories O
of O
the O
Crown B-Organization
, O
the O
property O
of O
no O
American O
, O
and O
for O
the O
defence O
of O
a O
trade O
purely O
British O
, O
was O
really O
a O
British O
war—and O
yet O
the O
people O
of O
America B-Location
made O
no O
scruple O
of O
contributing O
their O
utmost O
towards O
carrying O
it O
on O
, O
and O
bringing O
it O
to O
a O
happy O
conclusion O
. O

Q O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
then O
that O
the O
taking O
possession O
of O
the O
King B-Organization
’ O
s O
territorial O
rights O
, O
and O
strengthening O
the O
frontiers O
, O
is O
not O
an O
American O
interest O
? O

A O
. O

Not O
particularly O
, O
but O
conjointly O
a O
British O
and O
an O
American O
interest O
. O

Q O
. O

You O
will O
not O
deny O
that O
the O
preceding O
war O
, O
the O
war O
with O
Spain B-Organization
, O
was O
entered O
into O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
America B-Location
; O
was O
it O
not O
occasioned O
by O
captures O
made O
in O
the O
American B-Location
seas I-Location
? O

A O
. O

Yes O
; O
captures O
of O
ships O
carrying O
on O
the O
British O
trade O
there O
, O
with O
British O
manufactures O
. O

Q O
. O

Was O
not O
the O
late O
war O
with O
the O
Indians O
, O
since O
the O
peace O
with O
France B-Organization
, O
a O
war O
for O
America B-Location
only O
? O

A O
. O

Yes O
; O
it O
was O
more O
particularly O
for O
America B-Location
than O
the O
former O
, O
but O
it O
was O
rather O
a O
consequence O
or O
remains O
of O
the O
former O
war O
, O
the O
Indians O
not O
having O
been O
thoroughly O
pacified O
, O
and O
the O
Americans O
bore O
by O
much O
the O
greatest O
share O
of O
the O
expence O
. O

It O
was O
put O
an O
end O
to O
by O
the O
army O
under O
General B-Person
Bouquet I-Person
; O
there O
were O
not O
above O
300 O
regulars O
in O
that O
army O
, O
and O
above O
1000 O
Pennsylvanians O
. O

Q O
. O

Is O
it O
not O
necessary O
to O
send O
troops O
to O
America B-Location
, O
to O
defend O
the O
Americans O
against O
the O
Indians O
? O

A O
. O

No O
, O
by O
no O
means O
; O
it O
never O
was O
necessary O
. O

They O
defended O
themselves O
when O
they O
were O
but O
an O
handful O
, O
and O
the O
Indians O
much O
more O
numerous O
. O

They O
continually O
gained O
ground O
, O
and O
have O
driven O
the O
Indians O
over O
the O
mountains B-Location
, O
without O
any O
troops O
sent O
to O
their O
assistance O
from O
this O
country B-Organization
. O

And O
can O
it O
be O
thought O
necessary O
now O
to O
send O
troops O
for O
their O
defence O
from O
those O
diminished O
Indian O
tribes O
, O
when O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
are O
become O
so O
populous O
, O
and O
so O
strong O
? O

There O
is O
not O
the O
least O
occasion O
for O
it O
; O
they O
are O
very O
able O
to O
defend O
themselves O
. O

Q O
. O

Do O
you O
say O
there O
were O
no O
more O
than O
300 O
regular O
troops O
employed O
in O
the O
late O
Indian O
war O
? O

A O
. O

Not O
on O
the O
Ohio B-Location
, O
or O
the O
frontiers B-Location
of I-Location
Pennsylvania I-Location
, O
which O
was O
the O
chief O
part O
of O
the O
war O
that O
affected O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
. O

There O
were O
garrisons O
at O
Niagara B-Location
, O
Fort B-Location
Detroit I-Location
, O
and O
those O
remote O
posts O
kept O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
your O
trade O
; O
I O
did O
not O
reckon O
them O
, O
but O
I O
believe O
that O
on O
the O
whole O
the O
number O
of O
Americans O
, O
or O
provincial O
troops O
, O
employed O
in O
the O
war O
, O
was O
greater O
than O
that O
of O
the O
regulars O
. O

I O
am O
not O
certain O
, O
but O
I O
think O
so O
. O

Q O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
the O
assemblies O
have O
a O
right O
to O

money O
on O
the O

there O
, O
to O
grant O
to O
the O
Crown B-Organization

A O
. O

I O
certainly O
think O
so O
; O
they O
have O
always O
done O
it O
. O

Q O
. O

Are O
they O
acquainted O
with O
the O
declaration O
of O
rights O
? O

and O
do O
they O
know O
that O
, O
by O
that O
statute O
, O
money O
is O
not O
to O
be O
raised O
on O
the O
subject O
but O
by O
consent O
of O
parliament B-Organization
? O

A O
. O

They O
are O
very O
well O
acquainted O
with O
it O
. O

Q O
. O

How O
then O
can O
they O
think O
they O
have O
a O
right O
to O
levy O
money O
for O
the O
Crown B-Organization
, O
or O
for O
any O
other O
than O
local O
purposes O
? O

A O
. O

They O
understand O
that O
clause O
to O
relate O
to O
subjects O
only O
within O
the O
realm O
; O
that O
no O
money O
can O
be O
levied O
on O
them O
for O
the O
Crown B-Organization
, O
but O
by O
consent O
of O
parliament B-Organization
. O

The O
Colonies B-Organization
are O
not O
supposed O
to O
be O
within O
the O
realm O
; O
they O
have O
assemblies O
of O
their O
own O
, O
which O
are O
their O
parliaments B-Organization
, O
and O
they O
are O
in O
that O
respect O
in O
the O
same O
situation O
with O
Ireland B-Organization
. O

When O
money O
is O
to O
be O
raised O
for O
the O
Crown B-Organization
upon O
the O
subject O
in O
Ireland B-Location
, O
or O
in O
the O

the O

parliament B-Organization
of I-Organization
Ireland I-Organization
, O
or O
in O
the O
assemblies B-Organization
of I-Organization
the I-Organization
Colonies I-Organization

They O
think O
the O
parliament B-Organization
of I-Organization
Great-Britain I-Organization
cannot O
properly O
give O
that O
consent O
till O
it O
has O
representatives O
from O

; O
for O
the O
petition O
of O
right O
expressly O
says O
, O
it O
is O
to O
be O
by O
common O
consent O
in O

and O
the O
people O
of O

have O
no O
representatives O
in O
parliament B-Organization
, O
to O
make O
a O
part O
of O
that O
common O
consent O
. O

Q O
. O

If O
the O
stamp-act O
should O
be O
repealed O
, O
and O
an O
act O
should O
pass O
, O
ordering O
the O
assemblies O
of O
the O

to O
indemnify O
the O
sufferers O
by O
the O
riots O
, O
would O
they O
obey O
it O
? O

A O
. O

That O
is O
a O
question O
I O
cannot O
answer O
. O

Q O

Suppose O
the O
King B-Organization
should O
require O
the O
Colonies B-Location
to O
grant O
a O
revenue O
, O
and O
the O
parliament B-Organization
should O
be O
against O

they O
think O

can O
grant O

to O
the O
King B-Organization
, O
without O
the O
consent O
of O
the O
parliament B-Organization
of I-Organization
G I-Organization
Britain I-Organization
? O

A O
. O

That O
is O
a O
deep O
question O
. O

— O
As O
to O
my O
own O
opinion O
, O
I O
should O
think O
myself O
at O
liberty O
to O
do O
it O
, O
and O
should O
do O
it O
, O
if O
I O
liked O
the O
occasion O
. O

Q O
. O

When O
money O
has O
been O
raised O
in O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
upon O
requisitions O
, O
has O
it O
not O
been O
granted O
to O
the O
King B-Organization
? O

A O
. O

Yes O
, O
always O
; O
but O
the O
requisitions O
have O
generally O
been O
for O
some O
service O
expressed O
, O
as O
to O
raise O
, O
clothe O
and O
pay O
troops O
, O
and O
not O
for O
money O
only O
. O

Q O
. O

If O
the O
act O
should O
pass O
, O
requiring O
the O
American O
assemblies O
to O
make O
compensation O
to O
the O
sufferers O
, O
and O
they O
should O
disobey O
it O
, O
and O
then O
the O
parliament B-Organization
should O
, O
by O
another O
act O
, O
lay O
an O
internal O
tax O
, O
would O
they O
then O
obey O
it O
? O

A O
. O

The O
people O
will O
pay O
no O
internal O
tax O
; O
and O
I O
think O
an O
act O
to O
oblige O
the O
assemblies B-Organization
to O
make O
compensation O
is O
unnecessary O
, O
for O
I O
am O
of O
opinion O
, O
that O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
present O
heats O
are O
abated O
, O
they O
will O
take O
the O
matter O
into O
consideration O
, O
and O
, O
if O
it O
is O
right O
to O
be O
done O
, O
they O
will O
do O
it O
of O
themselves O
. O

Q O
. O

Do O
not O
letters O

the O
post-offices O
in O
America B-Location

no O

Yes O

Q O

Can O
any O
private O
person O
take O
up O
those O

carry O
them O
as O
directed O
? O

A O
. O

Yes O
; O
any O
friend O
of O
the O
person O
may O
do O
it O
, O
paying O
the O
postage O
that O
has O
occurred O
. O

Q O

But O
must O
he O
not O
pay O
an O
additional O
postage O
for O
the O
distance O
to O
such O
inland O

? O

A O

No O

Q O

Can O
the O
post-master O
answer O
delivering O
the O
letter O
, O
without O
being O
paid O
such O
additional O

A O

Certainly O
he O
can O
demand O
nothing O
, O
where O
he O
does O
no O
service O

Q O

Suppose O
a O
person O
, O
being O
far O
from O

finds O
a O

which O
the O
post O
generally O
goes O
, O
and O
the O
letter O
is O
directed O

Are O

Q O

Is O
not O
this O
a O
tax O
on O
the O

A O

They O
do O
not O
consider O
it O
as O
such O
, O
as O
they O
have O
an O
advantage O
from O
persons O
travelling O
with O

Q O

If O
the O
stamp-act O
should O
be O
repealed O

should O
make O
a O
requisition O
to O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
for O
a O
sum O
of O
money O
, O
would O
they O
grant O
it O
? O

A O

I O
believe O
they O
would O

Q O

Why O
do O
you O
think O
so O
? O

A O
. O

I O
can O
speak O
for O
the O
Colony B-Organization

live O
in O
; O
I O
had O
it O
in O
instruction O
from O
the O
assembly B-Organization
to O
assure O
the O
ministry B-Organization
, O
that O
as O
they O
always O
had O
done O
, O
so O
they O
should O
always O
think O
it O
their O
duty O
to O
grant O
such O
aids O
to O
the O
Crown B-Organization
as O
were O
suitable O
to O
their O
circumstances O
and O
abilities O
, O
whenever O
called O
upon O
for O
the O
purpose O
, O
in O
the O
usual O
constitutional O
manner O
; O
and O
I O
had O
the O
honour O
of O
communicating O
this O
instruction O
to O
that O
honourable O
gentleman O
then O
minister O
. O

Q O
. O

Would O
they O
do O
this O
for O
a O
British O
concern O
; O
as O
suppose O
a O
war O
in O
some O
part O
of O
Europe B-Location
, O
that O
did O
not O
affect O
them O
? O

A O
. O

Yes O
, O
for O
any O
thing O
that O
concerned O
the O
general O
interest O

They O
consider O
themselves O
as O
a O
part O
of O
the O
whole O
. O

Q O

What O
is O
the O
usual O
constitutional O
manner O
of O
calling O
on O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
for O
aids O
? O

A O

A O
letter O
from O

Q O

Is O
this O
all O
you O
mean O
, O
a O
letter O
from O
the O
secretary B-Person
of I-Person
state I-Person
? O

A O
. O

I O
mean O
the O
usual O
way O
of O
requisition O
, O
in O
a O
circular O
letter O
from O
the O
secretary B-Person
of I-Person
state I-Person

reciting O
the O

recommending O
it O
to O
the O

to O
grant O
such O
aids O
as O
became O
their O
loyalty O
, O
and O
were O
suitable O
to O
their O
abilities O
. O

Q O
. O

Did O
the O
secretary B-Person
of I-Person
state I-Person
ever O
write O
for O
money O
for O
the O

? O

A O
. O

The O
requisitions O
have O
been O
to O
raise O
, O

and O
pay O
men O
, O
which O
cannot O
be O
done O
without O
money O
. O

Q O
. O

Would O
they O
grant O
money O
alone O
, O
if O
called O
on O
? O

A O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
they O
would O
, O
money O
as O
well O
as O
men O
, O
when O
they O
have O
money O
, O
or O
can O
make O
it O

Q O

If O
the O
parliament B-Organization
should O
repeal O
the O
stamp-act O
, O
will O
the O
assembly B-Organization
of I-Organization
Pennsylvania I-Organization
rescind O
their O
resolutions O
? O

A O
. O

I O
think O
not O
. O

Q O
. O

Before O
there O
was O
any O
thought O
of O
the O
stamp-act O
, O
did O
they O
wish O
for O
a O
representation O
in O
parliament B-Organization
? O

A O
. O

No O
. O

Q O
. O

Don O
’ O
t O
you O
know O
that O
there O
is O
, O
in O
the O
Pennsylvania O
charter O
, O
an O
express O
reservation O
of O
the O
right O
of O
parliament B-Organization
to O
lay O
taxes O
there O
? O

A O
. O

I O
know O
there O
is O
a O
clause O
in O
the O
charter O
, O
by O
which O
the O
King B-Organization
grants O
that O
he O
will O
levy O
no O
taxes O
on O
the O
inhabitants O
, O
unless O
it O
be O
with O
the O
consent O
of O
the O
assembly B-Organization
, O
or O
by O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
. O

Q O
. O

How O
then O
could O
the O
assembly B-Organization
of I-Organization
Pennsylvania I-Organization
assert O
, O
that O
laying O
a O
tax O
on O
them O
by O
the O
stamp-act O
was O
an O
infringement O
of O
their O
rights O
? O

A O
. O

They O
understand O
it O
thus O
; O
by O
the O
same O
charter O
, O
and O
otherwise O
, O
they O
are O
intitled O
to O
all O
the O
privileges O
and O
liberties O
of O
Englishmen O
; O
they O
find O
in O
the O
great O
charters O
, O
and O
the O
petition O
and O
declaration O
of O
rights O
, O
that O
one O
of O
the O
privileges O
of O
English O
subjects O
is O
, O
that O
they O
are O
not O
to O
be O
taxed O
but O
by O
their O
common O
consent O
; O
they O
have O
therefore O
relied O
upon O
it O
, O
from O
the O
first O
settlement O
of O
the O
province B-Location
, O
that O
the O
parliament B-Organization
never O
would O
, O
nor O
could O
, O
by O
colour O
of O
that O
clause O
in O
the O
charter O
, O
assume O
a O
right O
of O
taxing O
them O
, O
till O
it O
had O
qualified O
itself O
to O
exercise O
such O
right O
, O
by O
admitting O
representatives O
from O
the O
people O
to O
be O
taxed O
, O
who O
ought O
to O
make O
a O
part O
of O
that O
common O
consent O
. O

Q O
. O

Are O
there O
any O
words O
in O
the O
charter O
that O
justify O
that O
construction O
? O

A O
. O

The O
common O
rights O
of O
Englishmen O
, O
as O
declared O
by O
Magna O
Charta O
, O
and O
the O
petition O
of O
right O
, O
all O
justify O
it O
. O

Q O
. O

Does O
the O
distinction O
between O
internal O
and O
external O
taxes O
exist O
in O
the O
words O
of O
the O
charter O
? O

A O
. O

No O
, O
I O
believe O
not O
. O

Q O
. O

Then O
may O
they O
not O
, O
by O
the O
same O
interpretation O
, O
object O
to O
the O
parliament B-Organization
’ O
s O
right O
of O
external O
taxation O
? O

A O
. O

They O
never O
have O
hitherto O
. O

Many O
arguments O
have O
been O
lately O
used O
here O
to O
shew O
them O
that O
there O
is O
no O
difference O
, O
and O
that O
if O
you O
have O
no O
right O
to O
tax O
them O
internally O
, O
you O
have O
none O
to O
tax O
them O
externally O
, O
or O
make O
any O
other O
law O
to O
bind O
them O
. O

At O
present O
they O
do O
not O
reason O
so O
, O
but O
in O
time O
they O
may O
possibly O
be O
convinced O
by O
these O
arguments O
. O

Q O
. O

Do O
not O
the O
resolutions O
of O
the O
Pennsylvania B-Organization
assembly I-Organization
say O
all O
taxes O
? O

A O
. O

If O
they O
do O
, O
they O
mean O
only O
internal O
taxes O
; O
the O
same O
words O
have O
not O
always O
the O
same O
meaning O
here O
and O
in O
the O
Colonies B-Location
. O

By O
taxes O
they O
mean O
internal O
taxes O
; O
by O
duties O
they O
mean O
customs O
; O
these O
are O
their O
ideas O
of O
the O
language O
. O

Q O
. O

Have O
you O
not O
seen O
the O
resolutions O
of O
the O
Massachusetts B-Organization
Bay I-Organization
assembly I-Organization
? O

A O
. O

I O
have O
. O

Q O
. O

Do O
they O
not O
say O
, O
that O
neither O
external O
nor O
internal O
taxes O
can O
be O
laid O
on O
them O
by O
parliament B-Organization
? O

A O
. O

I O
don O
’ O
t O
know O
that O
they O
do O
; O
I O
believe O
not O
. O

Q O
. O

If O
the O
same O
Colony O
should O
say O
neither O
tax O
nor O
imposition O
could O
be O
laid O
, O
does O
not O
that O
province O
hold O
the O
power O
of O
parliament B-Organization
can O
hold O
neither O
? O

A O
. O

I O
suppose O
that O
by O
the O
word O
imposition O
, O
they O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
express O
duties O
to O
be O
laid O
on O
goods O
imported O
, O
as O
regulations O
of O
commerce O
. O

Q O
. O

What O
can O
the O
Colonies B-Location
mean O
then O
by O
imposition O
as O
distinct O
from O
taxes O
? O

A O
. O

They O
may O
mean O
many O
things O
, O
as O
impressing O
of O
men O
, O
or O
of O
carriages O
, O
quartering O
troops O
on O
private O
houses O
, O
and O
the O
like O
; O
there O
may O
be O
great O
impositions O
, O
that O
are O
not O
properly O
taxes O
. O

Q O
. O

Is O
not O
the O
post-office O
rate O
an O
internal O
tax O
laid O
by O
act O
of O
parliament B-Organization
? O

A O
. O

I O
have O
answered O
that O
. O

Q O
. O

Are O
all O
parts O
of O
the O
Colonies B-Organization
equally O
able O
to O
pay O
taxes O
? O

A O
. O

No O
, O
certainly O
; O
the O
frontier B-Location
parts I-Location
, O
which O
have O
been O
ravaged O
by O
the O
enemy O
, O
are O
greatly O
disabled O
by O
that O
means O
, O
and O
therefore O
, O
in O
such O
cases O
, O
are O
usually O
favoured O
in O
our O
tax O
laws O
. O

Q O
. O

Can O
we O
, O
at O
this O
distance O
, O
be O
competent O
judges O
of O
what O
favours O
are O
necessary O
? O

A O
. O

The O
parliament B-Organization
have O
supposed O
it O
, O
by O
claiming O
a O
right O
to O
make O
tax O
laws O
for O
America B-Organization
; O
I O
think O
it O
impossible O
. O

Q O
. O

Would O
the O
repeal O
of O
the O
stamp-act O
be O
any O
discouragement O
of O
your O
manufactures O
? O

Will O
the O
people O
that O
have O
begun O
to O
manufacture O
decline O
it O
? O

A O

Yes O
, O
I O
think O
they O
will O
; O
especially O
if O
, O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
the O
trade O
is O
opened O
again O
, O
so O
that O
remittances O
can O
be O
easily O
made O
. O

I O
have O
known O
several O
instances O
that O
make O
it O
probable O
. O

In O
the O
war O
before O
last O
, O
tobacco O
being O
low O
, O
and O
making O
little O
remittance O
, O
the O
people O
of O
Virginia B-Location
went O
generally O
into O
family O
manufactures O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
when O
tobacco O
bore O
a O
better O
price O
, O
they O
returned O
to O
the O
use O
of O
British O
manufactures O
. O

So O
fulling O
mills O
were O
very O
much O
difused O
in O
the O
last O
war O
in O
Pennsylvania B-Location
, O
because O
bills O
were O
then O
plenty O
, O
and O
remittances O
could O
easily O
be O
made O
to O
Britain B-Organization
for O
English O
cloth O
and O
other O
goods O
. O

Q O
. O

If O
the O
stamp-act O
should O
be O
repealed O
, O
would O
it O
induce O
the O
assemblies B-Organization
of I-Organization
America I-Organization
to O
acknowledge O
the O
rights O
of O
parliament B-Organization
to O
tax O
them O
, O
and O
would O
they O
erase O
their O
resolutions O
? O

A O
. O

No O
, O
never O
. O

Q O
. O

Is O
there O
no O
means O
of O
obliging O
them O
to O
erase O
those O
resolutions O
? O

A O
. O

None O
that O
I O
know O
of O
; O
they O
will O
never O
do O
it O
unless O
compelled O
by O
force O
of O
arms O
. O

Q O
. O

Is O
there O
a O
power O
on O
earth O
that O
can O
force O
them O
to O
erase O
them O
? O

A O
. O

No O
power O
, O
how O
great O
soever O
, O
can O
force O
men O
to O
change O
their O
opinions O
. O

Q O
. O

Do O
they O
consider O
the O
post-office O
as O
a O
tax O
, O
or O
as O
a O
regulation O
? O

A O
. O

Not O
as O
a O
tax O
, O
but O
as O
a O
regulation O
and O
conveniency O
; O
every O
assembly O
encouraged O
it O
, O
and O
supported O
it O
in O
its O
infancy O
, O
by O
grants O
of O
money O
, O
which O
they O
would O
not O
otherwise O
have O
done O
; O
and O
the O
people O
have O
always O
paid O
the O
postage O
. O

Q O
. O

When O
did O
you O
receive O
the O
instructions O
you O
mentioned O
? O

A O
. O

I O
brought O
them O
with O
me O
, O
when O
I O
came O
to O
England B-Location
, O
about O
15 O
months O
since O
. O

Q O
. O

When O
did O
you O
communicate O
that O
instruction O
to O
the O
minister O
? O

A O
. O

Soon O
after O
my O
arrival O
, O
while O
the O
stamping O
of O
America B-Organization
was O
under O
consideration O
, O
and O
before O
the O
bill O
was O
brought O
in O
. O

Q O
. O

Would O
it O
be O
most O
for O
the O
interest O
of O
Great-Britain B-Organization
, O
to O
employ O
the O
hands O
of O
Virginia B-Location
in O
tobacco O
, O
or O
in O
manufactures O
? O

A O
. O

In O
tobacco O
to O
be O
sure O
. O

Q O
. O

What O
used O
to O
be O
the O
pride O
of O
the O
Americans O
? O

A O
. O

To O
indulge O
in O
the O
fashions O
and O
manufactures O
of O
Great-Britain B-Location
. O

Q O
. O

What O
is O
now O
their O
pride O
? O

A O

To O
wear O
their O
old O
cloaths O
over O
again O

till O
they O
can O
make O
new O
